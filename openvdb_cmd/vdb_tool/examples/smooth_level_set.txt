# This examples demonstrates how to read a polygon mesh from a ply file,
# converting it into a narrow-band level set, smooth the level set,
# converting the level set into an adaptive polygon mesh and writing out
# the mesh to a binary ply file.

# read level set from openvdb file
read bunny.vdb

# Gaussian filtering of level set
# number of iterations is 5
# spatial discretization is 5'th order WENO
# temporal discretization is 1'th order TVD-RK
# size of the filter kernel is 1.0 voxels
gauss iter=5 space=5 time=1 size=1

# write level set to file
write bunny_smooth.vdb
