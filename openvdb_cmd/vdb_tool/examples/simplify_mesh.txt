# This examples demonstrates how to read a polygon mesh from a ply file,
# converting it into a narrow-band level set, converting the level set
# into an adaptive polygon mesh and writing out the mesh to a binary ply file.

# read OpenVDB file with points
read bunny.ply

# Mesh to level set conversion
# dimension is 256 voxels
# narrow-band level set width is 3 voxel units
mesh2ls dim=256 width=3

# Level set to polygon mesh conversion
# Mesh adaptivity is 0.25 %
ls2mesh adapt=0.25

# write polygon mesh to binary ply file
write bunny_smooth.ply
