# This examples demonstrates how to read a narrow-band level set
# from an OpenVDB file, dilating it, and writing out the level set
# to a different OpenVDB file.

# read level set from openvdb file
read bunny.vdb

# Dilate level set
# radius of dilation is 5.0 voxels
# spatial discretization is 5'th order WENO
# temporal discretization is 1'th order TVD-RK
dilate radius=5 space=5 time=1

# write level set to file
write bunny_dilated.vdb
