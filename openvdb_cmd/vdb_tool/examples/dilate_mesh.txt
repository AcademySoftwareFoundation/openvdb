# This examples demonstrates how to read a polygon mesh from a ply file,
# converting it into a narrow-band level set, dilating the level set,
# converting the level set into an adaptive polygon mesh and writing out
# the mesh to a binary ply file.

# read mesh
read bunny.ply

# Mesh to level set conversion
# dimension is 256 voxels
# narrow-band level set width is 3 voxel units
mesh2ls dim=256 width=3

# Dilate level set
# radius of dilation is 5.0 voxels
# spatial discretization is 5'th order WENO
# temporal discretization is 1'th order TVD-RK
dilate radius=5 space=5 time=1

# Level set to polygon mesh conversion
# Mesh adaptivity is 0.1 %
ls2mesh adapt=0.1

# write polygon mesh to binary ply file
write bunny_dilated.ply
