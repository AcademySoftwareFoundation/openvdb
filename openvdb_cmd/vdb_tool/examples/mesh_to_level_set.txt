# This examples demonstrates how to read a polygon mesh from a ply file,
# converting it into a narrow-band level set, and writing out the level set
# to an OpenVDB file.

# read OpenVDB file with points
read bunny.ply

# Mesh to level set conversion
# dimension is 256 voxel
# narrow-band level set width is 3 voxel units
mesh2ls dim=256 width=3

# write level set to an openvdb fie
write bunny.vdb
