@mainpage OpenVDB Points

The @b OpenVDB @b Points library extends Dreamworks' @b OpenVDB library to provide the
ability to efficiently represent point and attribute data in VDB Grids. Points
are spatially-organised into VDB voxels to provide faster access and a greater
opportunity for data compression compared with linear point arrays. By building
on top of OpenVDB, this library can re-use a lot of the work already in place
for the large, open-source OpenVDB toolset and active community of users.

The primary intended audience for this library is simulation and rendering for
VFX studios. This is a particularly data-intensive portion of a production
pipeline where the effects of improved data compression, I/O and performance
are most beneficial.

This initial Beta release contains the core Attribute API and a Houdini
plug-in.

This library was presented at Siggraph 2015 for which the slides can be
found online at <a href="http://www.openvdb.org/download/openvdb_particle_storage_2015.pdf">Advanced
Applications in Particle Storage at Double Negative</a>.
