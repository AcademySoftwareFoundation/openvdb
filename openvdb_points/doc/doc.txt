/**
@mainpage OpenVDB Points

The @b OpenVDB @b Points library extends Dreamworks' @b OpenVDB library to provide the
ability to efficiently represent point and attribute data in VDB Grids. Points
are spatially-organised into VDB voxels to provide faster access and a greater
opportunity for data compression compared with linear point arrays. By building
on top of OpenVDB, this library can re-use a lot of the work already in place
for the large, open-source OpenVDB toolset and active community of users.

See the <a href="https://github.com/dneg/openvdb_points_dev">GitHub Overview</A> for a more comprehensive introduction to the library.

See the @subpage codeExamples "Cookbook" to get started using @b OpenVDB @b Points.

See the @subpage changes "Release Notes" for what's new in this version of @b OpenVDB @b Points.

Contributors, please familiarize yourselves with OpenVDB's "coding standards".
