/**
@mainpage OpenVDB Points

The @b OpenVDB @b Points library is an extension to the @b OpenVDB library
to add support for storing point data in a VDB Grid. Points are
spatially organised into VDB voxels which offers faster access and a
greater opportunity for data compression compared with linear point arrays.

The library has been developed by Double Negative in collaboration with
Dreamworks Animation. While the open-source library is currently hosted
by Double Negative, the intention is to integrate the source into the main
OpenVDB repository once the library is deemed sufficiently stable.

This initial Beta release contains the core Attribute API and a Houdini
plug-in.

This library was presented at Siggraph 2015 for which the slides can be
found online at <a href="http://www.openvdb.org/download/openvdb_particle_storage_2015.pdf">Advanced
Applications in Particle Storage at Double Negative</a>.

@b OpenVDB @b Points is maintained by

and was developed primarily by

- Nick Avramoussis (Dneg)
