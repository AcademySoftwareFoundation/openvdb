                            OpenVDB Points
========================================================================

The OpenVDB Points library extends Dreamworks' OpenVDB library to provide
the ability to efficiently represent point and attribute data in VDB Grids.
Points are spatially-organised into VDB voxels to provide faster access and
a greater opportunity for data compression compared with linear point arrays.

For instructions on library installation and dependencies see INSTALL

For documentation of the library and code examples see:
dneg.github.io/openvdb_points_dev
