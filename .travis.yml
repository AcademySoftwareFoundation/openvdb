# Travis yaml script to configure continous integration
#
# Author: Dan Bailey

# OpenVDB requires Ubuntu Trusty 14.04 or later which Travis does not yet
# support using the faster Container-based infrastructure

# Linux-only for now, however Travis also supports Mac OSX
os: linux

# Build with Clang only as GCC is slower and consumes more memory during compilation
compiler: clang
