@page changes Release Notes


@htmlonly <a name="v2_0_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 2.0.0</B> - <I>October 31, 2013</I>
- Added a @ref python "Python module" with functions for basic manipulation
  of grids (but no tools, yet).
- Added ray intersector tools for efficient, hierarchical intersection
  of rays with @vdblink::tools::LevelSetRayIntersector level-set@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::VolumeRayIntersector generic@endlink volumes.
- Added a @vdblink::math::Ray Ray@endlink class and a hierarchical
  @vdblink::math::DDA Digital Differential Analyzer@endlink for fast
  ray traversal.
- Added a fully multi-threaded @vdblink::tools::LevelSetRayTracer 
  level set ray tracer@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::PerspectiveCamera camera@endlink
  @vdblink::tools::OrthographicCamera classes@endlink
  that mimic Houdini&rsquo;s cameras.
- Added a simple, command-line renderer (currently for level sets only).
- Implemented a new meshing scheme that produces topologically robust
  two-manifold meshes and is twice as fast as the previous scheme.
- Implemented a new, topologically robust (producing two-manifold meshes)
  level-set-based seamless fracture scheme.  The new scheme eliminates
  visible scarring seen in the previous implementation by subdividing
  internal, nonplanar quads near fracture seams.  In addition,
  fracture seam points are now tagged, allowing them to be used
  to drive pre-fracture dynamics such as local surface buckling.
- Improved the performance of @vdblink::tree::Tree::evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox()
  Tree::evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::activeVoxelCount() Tree::activeVoxelCount@endlink,
  and significantly improved the performance of
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::evalLeafBoundingBox() Tree::evalLeafBoundingBox@endlink
  (by about&nbsp;30x).
- Added a tool (and a Houdini SOP) that fills a volume with
  adaptively-sized overlapping or non-overlapping spheres.
- Added a Ray SOP that can be used to perform geometry projections
  using level-set ray intersections or closest-point queries.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::ClosestSurfacePoint tool@endlink that performs
  accelerated closest surface point queries from arbitrary points in
  world space to narrow-band level sets.
- Increased the speed of masked level set filtering by 20% for
  the most common cases.
- Added @vdblink::math::BoxStencil math::BoxStencil@endlink, with support
  for trilinear interpolation and gradient computation.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::topologyIntersection()
  Tree::topologyIntersection@endlink, which intersects a tree&rsquo;s active
  values with those of another tree, and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::topologyDifference() Tree::topologyDifference@endlink,
  which performs topological subtraction of one tree&rsquo;s active values
  from another&rsquo;s.  In both cases, the <TT>ValueType</TT>s of the two
  trees need not be the same.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::activeTileCount() Tree::activeTileCount@endlink,
  which returns the number of active tiles in a tree.
- Added @vdblink::math::MinIndex() math::MinIndex@endlink and 
  @vdblink::math::MaxIndex() math::MaxIndex@endlink, which find the minimum
  and maximum components of a vector without any branching.
- Added @vdblink::math::BBox::minExtent() BBox::minExtent@endlink,
  which returns a bounding box&rsquo;s shortest axis.
- The default @vdblink::math::BBox BBox@endlink constructor now
  generates an invalid bounding box rather than an empty bounding box
  positioned at the origin.  The new behavior is consistent with
  @vdblink::math::CoordBBox CoordBBox@endlink.
  <I>[Thanks to Rick Hankins for suggesting this fix.]</I>
- Added @vdblink::math::CoordBBox::reset() CoordBBox::reset@endlink,
  which resets a bounding box to its initial, invalid state.
- Fixed a bug in the default @vdblink::math::ScaleMap ScaleMap@endlink
  constructor that left some data used in the inverse uninitialized.
- Added @vdblink::math::MapBase::applyJT MapBase::applyJT@endlink, which
  applies the Jacobian transpose to a vector (the Jacobian transpose takes
  a range-space vector to a domain-space vector, e.g., world to index),
  and added @vdblink::math::MapBase::inverseMap() MapBase::inverseMap@endlink,
  which returns a new map representing the inverse of the original map
  (except for @vdblink::math::NonlinearFrustumMap NonlinearFrustumMap@endlink,
  which does not currently have a defined inverse map).
  <br>@b Note: Houdini 12.5 uses an earlier version of OpenVDB, and maps
  created with that version lack virtual table entries for these
  new methods, so do not call these methods from Houdini&nbsp;12.5.
- Reimplemented @vdblink::math::RandomInt math::RandomInt@endlink using
  Boost.Random instead of @c rand() (which is not thread-safe), and deprecated
  @vdblink::math::randUniform math::randUniform@endlink and added
  @vdblink::math::Random01 math::Random01@endlink to replace it. 
- Modified @vdblink::tools::copyFromDense() tools::copyFromDense@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::copyToDense() tools::copyToDense@endlink to allow
  for implicit type conversion (e.g., between a
  @vdblink::tools::Dense Dense&lt;Int32&gt;@endlink and a
  @vdblink::FloatTree FloatTree@endlink) and fixed several bugs
  in @vdblink::tools::CopyFromDense tools::CopyFromDense@endlink.
- Fixed bugs in @vdblink::math::Stats math::Stats@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::Histogram math::Histogram@endlink that could produce
  <TT>NaN</TT>s or other incorrect behavior if certain methods were called
  on populations of size zero.
- Renamed <TT>struct tolerance</TT> to
  @vdblink::math::Tolerance math::Tolerance@endlink
  and @c negative to @vdblink::math::negative() math::negative@endlink
  and removed @c math::toleranceValue().
- Implemented a closest point on line segment algorithm,
  @vdblink::math::closestPointOnSegmentToPoint()
  math::closestPointOnSegmentToPoint@endlink.
- Fixed meshing issues relating to masking and automatic partitioning.
- @vdblink::Grid::merge() Grid::merge@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::merge() Tree::merge@endlink now accept an optional
  @vdblink::MergePolicy MergePolicy@endlink argument that specifies one of
  three new merging schemes.  (The old merging scheme, which is no longer
  available, used logic for each tree level that was inconsistent with
  the other levels and that could result in active tiles being replaced
  with nodes having only inactive values.)
- Renamed @c LeafNode::coord2offset(), @c LeafNode::offset2coord() and
  @c LeafNode::offset2globalCoord() to
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::coordToOffset() coordToOffset@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::offsetToLocalCoord() offsetToLocalCoord@endlink,
  and @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::offsetToGlobalCoord()
  offsetToGlobalCoord@endlink, respectively, and likewise for
  @vdblink::tree::InternalNode::offsetToGlobalCoord() InternalNode@endlink.
- Replaced @vdblink::tree::Tree Tree@endlink methods @c setValueOnMin,
  @c setValueOnMax and @c setValueOnSum with
  @vdblink::tools::setValueOnMin() tools::setValueOnMin@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::setValueOnMax() tools::setValueOnMax@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::setValueOnSum() tools::setValueOnSum@endlink
  (and a new @vdblink::tools::setValueOnMult() tools::setValueOnMult@endlink)
  and added @vdblink::tree::Tree::modifyValue() Tree::modifyValue@endlink
  and @vdblink::tree::Tree::modifyValueAndActiveState()
  Tree::modifyValueAndActiveState@endlink, which modify voxel values
  in-place via user-supplied functors.  Similarly, replaced
  @c ValueAccessor::setValueOnSum() with
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::modifyValue()
  ValueAccessor::modifyValue@endlink
  and @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::modifyValueAndActiveState()
  ValueAccessor::modifyValueAndActiveState@endlink, and added a
  @vdblink::tree::TreeValueIteratorBase::modifyValue() modifyValue@endlink
  method to all value iterators.
- Removed @c LeafNode::addValue and @c LeafNode::scaleValue.
- Added convenience classes @vdblink::tree::Tree3 tree::Tree3@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree5 tree::Tree5@endlink for custom tree configurations.
- Added an option to the From Particles SOP to generate an alpha mask,
  which can be used to constrain level set filtering so as to preserve
  surface details.
- The mesh to volume converter now handles point-degenerate polygons.
- Fixed a bug in the Level Set Smooth, Level Set Renormalize and 
  Level Set Offset SOPs that caused the group name to be ignored. 
- Fixed various OS X and Windows build issues.

@htmlonly <a name="v1_2_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.2.0</B> - <I>June 28 2013</I>
- @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter Level set filters@endlink now accept
  an optional alpha mask grid.
- Implemented sharp feature extraction for level set surfacing.
  This enhances the quality of the output mesh and reduces aliasing
  artifacts.
- Added masking options to the meshing tools, as well as a spatial
  multiplier for the adaptivity threshold, automatic partitioning,
  and the ability to preserve edges and corners when mesh adaptivity
  is applied.
- The mesh to volume attribute transfer scheme now takes surface
  orientation into account, which improves accuracy in proximity to
  edges and corners.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::LeafManager::foreach() foreach@endlink method
  to @vdblink::tree::LeafManager tree::LeafManager@endlink that, like
  @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink, applies a user-supplied
  functor to each leaf node in parallel.
- Rewrote the particle to level set converter, simplifying the API,
  improving performance (especially when particles have a fixed radius),
  adding the capability to transfer arbitrary point attributes,
  and fixing a velocity trail bug.
- Added utility methods @vdblink::math::Sign() Sign@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::SignChange() SignChange@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::isApproxZero() isApproxZero@endlink,
  @vdblink::math::Cbrt() Cbrt@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::ZeroCrossing() ZeroCrossing@endlink to math/Math.h.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor3::probeNode() probeNode@endlink method
  to the value accessor and to tree nodes that returns a pointer to the node
  that contains a given voxel.
- Deprecated @c LeafNode::addValue and @c LeafNode::scaleValue.
- Doubled the speed of the mesh to volume converter (which also improves
  the performance of the fracture and level set rebuild tools) and
  improved its inside/outside voxel classification near edges and corners.
- @vdblink::tools::GridSampler GridSampler@endlink now accepts either a grid,
  a tree or a value accessor, and it offers faster index-based access methods
  and much better performance in cases where many instances are allocated.
- Extended @vdblink::tools::Dense tools::Dense@endlink to make it more
  compatible with existing tools. 
- Fixed a crash in @vdblink::io::Archive io::Archive@endlink whenever
  the library was unloaded from memory and then reloaded.
  <I>[Contributed by Ollie Harding]</I>
- Fixed a bug in @c GU_PrimVDB::buildFromPrimVolume(), seen during the
  conversion from Houdini volumes to OpenVDB grids, that could cause 
  signed flood fill to be applied to non-level set grids, resulting in
  active tiles with incorrect values.
- Added a Prune SOP with several pruning schemes.


@htmlonly <a name="v1_1_1_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.1.1</B> - <I>May 10 2013</I>
- Added a simple @vdblink::tools::Dense dense grid class@endlink and tools
  to copy data from dense voxel arrays into OpenVDB grids and vice-versa.
- Starting with Houdini 12.5.396, plugins built with this version
  of OpenVDB can coexist with native Houdini OpenVDB nodes.
- The level set fracture tool now smooths seam line edges during
  mesh extraction, eliminating staircase artifacts.
- Significantly improved the performance of the
  @vdblink::util::leafTopologyIntersection()
  leafTopologyIntersection@endlink and
  @vdblink::util::leafTopologyDifference() leafTopologyDifference@endlink
  utilities and added a @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::topologyDifference()
  LeafNode::topologyDifference@endlink method.
- Added convenience functions that provide simplified interfaces
  to the @vdblink::tools::meshToLevelSet() mesh to volume@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::volumeToMesh() volume to mesh@endlink converters.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::accumulate() tools::accumulate@endlink function
  that is similar to @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink
  but can be used to accumulate the results of computations over the values
  of a grid.
- Added @vdblink::tools::statistics() tools::statistics@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::opStatistics() tools::opStatistics@endlink and 
  @vdblink::tools::histogram() tools::histogram@endlink, which efficiently
  compute statistics (mean, variance, etc.) and histograms of grid values
  (using @vdblink::math::Stats math::Stats@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::Histogram math::Histogram@endlink).
- Modified @vdblink::math::CoordBBox CoordBBox@endlink to adhere to
  TBB&rsquo;s splittable type requirements, so that, for example,
  a @c CoordBBox can be used as a blocked iteration range.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::addTile() Tree::addTile@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::addLeaf() Tree::addLeaf@endlink and 
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::stealNode() Tree::stealNode@endlink, for fine 
  control over tree construction.
- Addressed a numerical stability issue when performing Gaussian
  filtering of level set grids.
- Changed the return type of @vdblink::math::CoordBBox::volume()
  CoordBBox::volume@endlink to reduce the risk of overflow.
- When the input mesh is self-intersecting, the mesh to volume converter
  now produces a level set with a monotonic gradient field.
- Fixed a threading bug in the mesh to volume converter that caused it
  to produce different results for the same input.
- Fixed a bug in the particle to level set converter that prevented
  particles with zero velocity from being rasterized in Trail mode.
- Added an optional input to the Create SOP into which to merge
  newly-created grids.
- Fixed a bug in the Resample SOP that caused it to produce incorrect
  narrow-band widths when resampling level set grids.
- Fixed a bug in the To Polygons SOP that caused intermittent crashes
  when the optional reference input was connected.
- Fixed a bug in the Advect Level Set SOP that caused a crash
  when the velocity input was connected but empty.
- The Scatter and Sample Point SOPs now warn instead of erroring
  when given empty grids. 
- Fixed a crash in @c vdb_view when stepping through multiple grids
  after changing render modes.
- @c vdb_view can now render fog volumes and vector fields, and it now
  features interactively adjustable clipping planes that enable
  one to view the interior of a volume.


@htmlonly <a name="v1_1_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.1.0</B> - <I>April 4 2013</I>
- The @vdblink::tools::resampleToMatch() resampleToMatch@endlink tool,
  the Resample SOP and the Combine SOP now use level set rebuild to correctly
  and safely resample level sets.  Previously, scaling a level set would
  invalidate the signed distance field, leading to holes and other artifacts.
- Added a mask-based topological
  @vdblink::tools::erodeVoxels erosion tool@endlink, and rewrote and
  simplified the @vdblink::tools::dilateVoxels dilation tool@endlink.
- The @vdblink::tools::LevelSetAdvection LevelSetAdvection@endlink tool
  can now advect forward or backward in time.
- @vdblink::tree::Tree::pruneLevelSet() Tree::pruneLevelSet@endlink now
  replaces each pruned node with a tile having the inside or outside
  background value, instead of arbitrarily selecting one of the node&rsquo;s
  tile or voxel values.
- When a grid is saved to a file with
  @vdblink::Grid::saveFloatAsHalf() saveFloatAsHalf@endlink set to @c true,
  the grid&rsquo;s background value is now also quantized to 16 bits.
  (Not quantizing the background value caused a mismatch with the values
  of background tiles.)
- As with @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink, it is now
  possible to specify whether functors passed to
  @vdblink::tools::transformValues() tools::transformValues@endlink
  should be shared across threads.
- @vdblink::tree::LeafManager tree::LeafManager@endlink can now be
  instantiated with a @const tree, although buffer swapping with @const trees
  is disabled.
- Added a @vdblink::Grid::signedFloodFill() Grid::signedFloodFill@endlink
  overload that allows one to specify inside and outside values.
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::Grid::setBackground() Grid::setBackground@endlink
  so that now only the values of inactive voxels change.
- Fixed @vdblink::Grid::topologyUnion() Grid::topologyUnion@endlink so that
  it actually unions tree topology, instead of just the active states
  of tiles and voxels.  The previous behavior broke multithreaded code
  that relied on input and output grids having compatible tree topology.
- @vdblink::math::Transform math::Transform@endlink now includes an
  @vdblink::math::Transform::isIdentity() isIdentity@endlink predicate
  and methods to @vdblink::math::Transform::preMult(const Mat4d&) pre-@endlink
  and @vdblink::math::Transform::postMult(const Mat4d&) postmultiply@endlink
  by a matrix.
- Modified the @link NodeMasks.h node mask@endlink classes to permit
  octree-like tree configurations (i.e., with a branching factor of two)
  and to use 64-bit operations instead of 32-bit operations.
- Implemented a new, more efficient
  @vdblink::math::closestPointOnTriangleToPoint() closest point
  on triangle@endlink algorithm.
- Implemented a new vertex normal scheme in the volume to mesh
  converter, and resolved some overlapping polygon issues. 
- The volume to mesh converter now meshes not just active voxels
  but also active tiles.
- Fixed a bug in the mesh to volume converter that caused unsigned
  distance field conversion to produce empty grids.
- Fixed a bug in the level set fracture tool whereby the cutter overlap
  toggle was ignored.
- Fixed an infinite loop bug in @c vdb_view.
- Updated @c vdb_view to use the faster and less memory-intensive
  OpenVDB volume to mesh converter instead of marching cubes,
  and rewrote the shader to be OpenGL 3.2 and GLSL 1.2 compatible.
- Given multiple input files or a file containing multiple grids,
  @c vdb_view now displays one grid at a time.  The left and right
  arrow keys cycle between grids.
- The To Polygons SOP now has an option to associate the input grid&rsquo;s
  name with each output polygon.


@htmlonly <a name="v1_0_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 1.0.0</B> - <I>March 14 2013</I>
- @vdblink::tools::levelSetRebuild() tools::levelSetRebuild@endlink
  now throws an exception when given a non-scalar or non-floating-point grid.
- The tools in tools/GridOperators.h are now interruptible, as is
  the Analysis SOP.
- Added a
  @vdblink::tree::LeafManager::LeafRange::Iterator leaf node iterator@endlink
  and a TBB-compatible
  @vdblink::tree::LeafManager::LeafRange range class@endlink
  to the LeafManager.
- Modified the @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh VolumeToMesh@endlink tool
  to handle surface topology issues around fracture seam lines.
- Modified the Makefile to allow @c vdb_view to compile on OS X systems
  (provided that GLFW is available).
- Fixed a bug in the Create SOP that resulted in "invalid parameter name"
  warnings.
- The Combine SOP now optionally resamples the A grid into the B grid&rsquo;s
  index space (or vice-versa) if the A and B transforms differ.
- The Vector Split and Vector Merge SOPs now skip inactive voxels
  by default, but they can optionally be made to include inactive voxels,
  as they did before.
- The @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFracture LevelSetFracture@endlink tool now
  supports custom rotations for each cutter instance, and the Fracture SOP
  now uses quaternions to generate uniformly-distributed random rotations.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_104_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.104.0</B> - <I>February 15 2013</I>
- Added a @vdblink::tools::levelSetRebuild() tool@endlink and a SOP
  to rebuild a level set from any scalar volume.
- @c .vdb files are now saved using a mask-based compression scheme
  that is an order of magnitude faster than Zip and produces comparable
  file sizes for level set and fog volume grids.  (Zip compression
  is still enabled by default for other classes of grids).
- The @vdblink::tools::Filter Filter@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter LevelSetFilter@endlink tools now
  include a Gaussian filter, and mean (box) filtering is now 10-50x faster.
- The isosurface @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh meshing tool@endlink
  is now more robust (to level sets with one voxel wide narrow bands,
  for example).
- Mesh to volume conversion is on average 1.5x faster and up to 5.5x
  faster for high-resolution meshes where the polygon/voxel size ratio
  is small.
- Added @vdblink::createLevelSet() createLevelSet@endlink and
  @vdblink::createLevelSetSphere() createLevelSetSphere@endlink
  factory functions for level set grids.
- @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor tree::ValueAccessor@endlink is now faster
  for trees of height 2, 3 and 4 (the latter is the default), and it now
  allows one to specify, via a template argument, the number of node levels
  to be cached, which can also improve performance in special cases.
- Added a toggle to @vdblink::tools::foreach() tools::foreach@endlink
  to specify whether or not the functor should be shared across threads.
- Added @vdblink::Mat4SMetadata Mat4s@endlink and
  @vdblink::Mat4DMetadata Mat4d@endlink metadata types.
- Added explicit pre- and postmultiplication methods to the @c Transform,
  @c Map and @c Mat4 classes and deprecated the old accumulation methods. 
- Modified @vdblink::math::NonlinearFrustumMap NonlinearFrustumMap@endlink
  to be more compatible with Houdini&rsquo;s frustum transform.
- Fixed a @vdblink::tools::GridTransformer GridTransformer@endlink bug
  that caused it to translate the output grid incorrectly in some cases.
- Fixed a bug in the tree-level
  @vdblink::tree::LeafIteratorBase LeafIterator@endlink that resulted in
  intermittent crashes in
  @vdblink::tools::dilateVoxels() tools::dilateVoxels@endlink.
- The @c Hermite data type and Hermite grids are no longer supported.
- Added tools/GridOperators.h, which includes new, cleaner implementations
  of the @vdblink::tools::cpt() closest point transform@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::curl() curl@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::divergence() divergence@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::gradient() gradient@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::laplacian() Laplacian@endlink, 
  @vdblink::tools::magnitude() magnitude@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::meanCurvature() mean curvature@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::normalize() normalize@endlink tools.
- Interrupt support has been improved in several tools, including
  @vdblink::tools::ParticlesToLevelSet tools::ParticlesToLevelSet@endlink.
- Simplified the API of the @vdblink::math::BaseStencil Stencil@endlink class
  and added an @vdblink::math::BaseStencil::intersects() intersects@endlink
  method to test for intersection with a specified isovalue.
- Renamed @c voxelDimensions to @c voxelSize in transform classes
  and elsewhere.
- Deprecated @c houdini_utils::ParmFactory::setChoiceList in favor of
  @c houdini_utils::ParmFactory::setChoiceListItems, which requires
  a list of <I>token, label</I> string pairs.
- Made various changes for Visual C++ compatibility.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- Fixed a bug in @c houdini_utils::getNodeChain() that caused the
  Offset Level Set, Smooth Level Set and Renormalize Level Set SOPs
  to ignore frame changes.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- The From Particles SOP now provides the option to write into
  an existing grid.
- Added a SOP to edit grid metadata.
- The Fracture SOP now supports multiple cutter objects.
- Added a To Polygons SOP that complements the Fracture SOP and allows
  for elimination of seam lines, generation of correct vertex normals
  and grouping of polygons when surfacing fracture fragments, using
  the original level set or mesh as a reference.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_103_1_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.103.1</B> - <I>January 15 2013</I>
- @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor tree::ValueAccessor@endlink read operations
  are now faster for four-level trees.
  (Preliminary benchmark tests suggest a 30-40% improvement.)
- For vector-valued grids, @vdblink::tools::compMin() tools::compMin@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::compMax() tools::compMax@endlink now compare
  vector magnitudes instead of individual components.
- Migrated grid sampling code to a new file, Interpolation.h,
  and deprecated old files and classes.
- Added a level-set @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFracture fracture tool@endlink
  and a Fracture SOP.
- Added @vdblink::tools::sdfInteriorMask() tools::sdfInteriorMask@endlink,
  which creates a mask of the interior region of a level set grid.
- Fixed a bug in the mesh to volume converter that produced unexpected
  nonzero values for voxels at the intersection of two polygons,
  and another bug that produced narrow-band widths that didn&rsquo;t respect
  the background value when the half-band width was less than three voxels.
- @c houdini_utils::ParmFactory can now correctly generate ramp multi-parms.
- Made various changes for Visual C++ compatibility.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- The Convert SOP can now convert between signed distance fields and
  fog volumes and from volumes to meshes.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- For level sets, the From Mesh and From Particles SOPs now match
  the reference grid&rsquo;s narrow-band width.
- The Scatter SOP can now optionally scatter points in the interior
  of a level set.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_103_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.103.0</B> - <I>December 21 2012</I>
- The mesh to volume converter is now 60% faster at generating
  level sets with wide bands, and the From Mesh SOP is now interruptible.
- Fixed a threading bug in the recently-added 
  @vdblink::tools::compReplace() compReplace@endlink tool
  that caused it to produce incorrect output.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::Tree::probeConstLeaf() probeConstLeaf@endlink
  method to the @vdblink::tree::Tree::probeConstLeaf() Tree@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::probeConstLeaf() ValueAccessor@endlink
  and @vdblink::tree::RootNode::probeConstLeaf() node@endlink classes.
- The Houdini VDB primitive doesn&rsquo;t create a @c name attribute
  unnecessarily (i.e., if its grid&rsquo;s name is empty), but it now
  correctly allows the name to be changed to the empty string.
- Fixed a crash in the Vector Merge SOP when fewer than three grids
  were merged.
- The From Particles SOP now features a "maximum half-width" parameter
  to help avoid runaway computations.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_102_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.102.0</B> - <I>December 13 2012</I>
- Added @vdblink::tools::compReplace() tools::compReplace@endlink,
  which copies the active values of one grid into another, and added
  a "Replace A With Active B" mode to the Combine SOP.
- @vdblink::Grid::signedFloodFill() Grid::signedFloodFill@endlink
  no longer enters an infinite loop when filling an empty grid.
- Fixed a bug in the particle to level set converter that sometimes
  produced level sets with holes, and fixed a bug in the SOP that
  could result in random output.
- Fixed an issue in the frustum preview feature of the Create SOP
  whereby rendering very large frustums could cause high CPU usage.
- Added streamline support to the constrained advection scheme
  in the Advect Points SOP.
- Added an Advect Level Set SOP.

<B>Version 0.101.1</B> - <I>December 11 2012</I> (DWA internal release)
- Partially reverted the Houdini VDB primitive&rsquo;s grid accessor methods
  to their pre-0.98.0 behavior.  A primitive&rsquo;s grid can once again
  be accessed by shared pointer, but now also by reference.
  Accessor methods for grid metadata have also been added, and the
  primitive now ensures that metadata and transforms are never shared.
- Fixed an intermittent crash in the From Particles SOP.

<B>Version 0.101.0</B> - <I>December 6 2012</I> (DWA internal release)
- Partially reverted the @vdblink::Grid Grid@endlink&rsquo;s
  @vdblink::Grid::tree() tree@endlink and
  @vdblink::Grid::transform() transform@endlink accessor methods
  to their pre-0.98.0 behavior, eliminating copy-on-write but
  preserving their return-by-reference semantics.  These methods
  are now supplemented with a suite of
  @vdblink::Grid::treePtr() shared@endlink
  @vdblink::Grid::baseTreePtr() pointer@endlink
  @vdblink::Grid::transformPtr() accessors@endlink.
- Restructured the @vdblink::tools::MeshToVolume
  mesh to volume converter@endlink for a 40% speedup
  and to be more robust to non-manifold geometry, to better preserve
  sharp features, to support arbitrary tree configurations and
  to respect narrow-band limits.
- Added a @c getNodeBoundingBox method to
  @vdblink::tree::RootNode::getNodeBoundingBox() RootNode@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::InternalNode::getNodeBoundingBox() InternalNode@endlink
  and @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::getNodeBoundingBox() LeafNode@endlink
  that returns the index space spanned by a node.
- Made various changes for Visual C++ compatibility.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- Renamed the Reshape Level Set SOP to Offset Level Set.
- Fixed a crash in the Convert SOP and added support for conversion
  of empty grids.

@par
<B>Version 0.100.0</B> - <I>November 30 2012</I> (DWA internal release)
- Greatly improved the performance of the level set to fog volume
  @vdblink::tools::sdfToFogVolume() converter@endlink.
- Improved the performance of the
  @vdblink::tools::Filter::median() median filter@endlink
  and of level set @vdblink::tools::csgUnion() CSG@endlink operations.
- Reintroduced
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::pruneLevelSet() Tree::pruneLevelSet@endlink,
  a specialized @vdblink::tree::Tree::pruneInactive() pruneInactive@endlink
  for level-set grids.
- Added utilities to the @c houdini_utils library to facilitate the
  collection of a chain of adjacent nodes of a particular type
  so that they can be cooked in a single step.  (For example,
  adjacent @c xform SOPs could be collapsed by composing their
  transformation matrices into a single matrix.)
- Added pruning and flood-filling options to the Convert SOP.
- Reimplemented the Filter SOP, omitting level-set-specific filters
  and adding node chaining (to reduce memory usage when applying
  several filters in sequence).
- Added a toggle to the Read SOP to read grid metadata and
  transforms only.
- Changed the attribute transfer scheme on the From Mesh and
  From Particles SOPs to allow for custom grid names and
  vector type metadata.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_99_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.99.0</B> - <I>November 21 2012</I>
- Added @vdblink::Grid Grid@endlink methods that return non-<TT>const</TT>
  tree and transform references without triggering deep copies,
  as well as @c const methods that return @c const shared pointers.
- Added @c Grid methods to @vdblink::Grid::addStatsMetadata populate@endlink
  a grid&rsquo;s metadata with statistics like the active voxel count, and to
  @vdblink::Grid::getStatsMetadata retrieve@endlink that metadata.
  By default, statistics are now computed and added to grids
  whenever they are written to <TT>.vdb</TT> files.
- Added @vdblink::io::File::readGridMetadata io::File::readGridMetadata@endlink
  and @vdblink::io::File::readAllGridMetadata
  io::File::readAllGridMetadata@endlink methods to read just the
  grid metadata and transforms from a <TT>.vdb</TT> file.
- Fixed numerical precision issues in the
  @vdblink::tools::csgUnion csgUnion@endlink,
  @vdblink::tools::csgIntersection csgIntersection@endlink
  and @vdblink::tools::csgDifference csgDifference@endlink
  tools, and added toggles to optionally disable postprocess pruning.
- Fixed an issue in @c vdb_view with the ordering of GL vertex buffer calls.
  <I>[Contributed by Bill Katz]</I>
- Fixed an intermittent crash in the
  @vdblink::tools::ParticlesToLevelSet ParticlesToLevelSet@endlink tool,
  as well as a race condition that could cause data corruption.
- The @c ParticlesToLevelSet tool and From Particles SOP can now transfer
  arbitrary point attribute values from the input particles to output voxels.
- Fixed a bug in the Convert SOP whereby the names of primitives
  were lost during conversion, and another bug that resulted in
  arithmetic errors when converting empty grids.
- Fixed a bug in the Combine SOP that caused the Operation selection
  to be lost.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_98_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.98.0</B> - <I>November 16 2012</I>
- @vdblink::tree::Tree Tree@endlink and
  @vdblink::math::Transform Transform@endlink objects (and
  @vdblink::Grid Grid@endlink objects in the context of Houdini SOPs)
  are now passed and accessed primarily by reference rather than by
  shared pointer.  See @subpage api_0_98_0 "Porting to OpenVDB 0.98.0"
  for details about this important API change.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- Reimplemented @vdblink::math::CoordBBox CoordBBox@endlink to address several
  off-by-one bugs related to bounding box dimensions.
- Fixed an off-by-one bug in @vdblink::Grid::evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox()
  evalActiveVoxelBoundingBox@endlink.
- Introduced the @vdblink::tree::LeafManager LeafManager@endlink class,
  which will eventually replace the @c LeafArray class.  @c LeafManager supports
  dynamic buffers stored as a structure of arrays (SOA), unlike @c LeafArray,
  which supports only static buffers stored as an array of structures (AOS).
- Improved the performance of the
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter LevelSetFilter@endlink and
  @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker LevelSetTracker@endlink tools by rewriting
  them to use the new @vdblink::tree::LeafManager LeafManager@endlink class.
- Added @vdblink::tree::Tree::setValueOnly() Tree::setValueOnly@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::setValueOnly()
  ValueAccessor::setValueOnly@endlink methods, which change the value of
  a voxel without changing its active state, and
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::probeLeaf() Tree::probeLeaf@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::probeLeaf() ValueAccessor::probeLeaf@endlink
  methods that return the leaf node that contains a given voxel (unless
  the voxel is represented by a tile).
- Added a @vdblink::tools::LevelSetAdvection LevelSetAdvection@endlink tool
  that propagates and tracks narrow-band level sets.
- Introduced a new @vdblink::tools::GridSampler GridSampler@endlink class
  that supports world-space (or index-space) sampling of grid values.
- Changed the interpretation of the
  @vdblink::math::NonlinearFrustumMap NonlinearFrustumMap@endlink&rsquo;s
  @em taper parameter to be the ratio of the near and far plane depths.
- Added a @c ParmFactory::setChoiceList() overload that accepts
  (@em token, @em label) string pairs, and a @c setDefault() overload that
  accepts an STL string.
- Fixed a crash in the Combine SOP in Copy B mode.
- Split the Level Set Filter SOP into three separate SOPs,
  Level Set Smooth, Level Set Reshape and Level Set Renormalize.
  When two or more of these nodes are connected in sequence, they interact
  to reduce memory usage: the last node in the sequence performs
  all of the operations in one step.
- The Advect Points SOP can now output polyline streamlines
  that trace the paths of the points.
- Added an option to the Analysis SOP to specify names for output grids.
- Added camera-derived frustum transform support to the Create SOP.


@htmlonly <a name="v0_97_0_changes"></a>@endhtmlonly
@par
<B>Version 0.97.0</B> - <I>October 18 2012</I>
- Added a narrow-band @vdblink::tools::LevelSetTracker level set
  interface tracking tool@endlink (up to fifth-order in space but currently
  only first-order in time, with higher temporal orders to be added soon).
- Added a @vdblink::tools::LevelSetFilter level set filter tool@endlink
  to perform unrestricted surface smoothing (e.g., Laplacian flow),
  filtering (e.g., mean value) and morphological operations (e.g.,
  morphological opening).
- Added adaptivity to the @vdblink::tools::VolumeToMesh
  level set meshing tool@endlink for faster mesh extraction with fewer
  polygons, without postprocessing.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::touchLeaf()
  ValueAccessor::touchLeaf@endlink method that creates (if necessary)
  and returns the leaf node containing a given voxel.  It can be used
  to preallocate leaf nodes over which to run parallel algorithms.
- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::Grid::merge() Grid::merge@endlink whereby
  active tiles were sometimes lost.
- Added @vdblink::tree::LeafManager LeafManager@endlink, which is similar
  to @c LeafArray but supports a dynamic buffer count and allocates buffers
  more efficiently.  Useful for temporal integration (e.g., for level set
  propagation and interface tracking), @c LeafManager is meant to replace
  @c LeafArray, which will be deprecated in the next release.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::fill() LeafNode::fill@endlink method
  to efficiently populate leaf nodes with constant values.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::Tree::visitActiveBBox() Tree::visitActiveBBox@endlink
  method that applies a functor to the bounding boxes of all active tiles
  and leaf nodes and that can be used to improve the performance of
  ray intersection tests, rendering of bounding boxes, etc.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::Tree::voxelizeActiveTiles()
  Tree::voxelizeActiveTiles@endlink method to densify active tiles.
  While convenient and fast, this can produce large dense grids, so use
  it with caution.
- Repackaged @c Tree::pruneLevelSet() as a
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::pruneOp() Tree::pruneOp()@endlink-compatible
  functor.  @vdblink::tree::LevelSetPrune LevelSetPrune@endlink is a
  specialized @vdblink::tree::Tree::pruneInactive() pruneInactive@endlink
  for level-set grids and is used in interface tracking.
- Added a @vdblink::GridBase::pruneGrid() GridBase::pruneGrid@endlink method.
- Added a @vdblink::Grid::hasUniformVoxels() Grid:hasUniformVoxels@endlink
  method.
- Renamed @c tools::dilate to
  @vdblink::tools::dilateVoxels() dilateVoxels@endlink and improved its
  performance.  The new name reflects the fact that the current
  implementation ignores active tiles.
- Added a @vdblink::tools::resampleToMatch() tools::resampleToMatch@endlink
  function that resamples an input grid into an output grid with a
  different transform such that, after resampling, the input and output grids
  coincide, but the output grid&rsquo;s transform is preserved.
- Significantly improved the performance of depth-bounded value
  iterators (@vdblink::tree::Tree::ValueOnIter ValueOnIter@endlink,
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::ValueAllIter ValueAllIter@endlink, etc.)
  when the depth bound excludes leaf nodes.
- Exposed the value buffers inside leaf nodes with
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::buffer() LeafNode::buffer@endlink.
  This allows for very fast access (const and non-const) to voxel
  values using linear array offsets instead of @ijk coordinates. 
- In openvdb_houdini/UT_VDBTools.h, added operators for use with
  @c processTypedGrid that resample grids in several different ways.
- Added a policy mechanism to @c houdini_utils::OpFactory that allows for
  customization of operator names, icons, and Help URLs.
- Renamed many of the Houdini SOPs to make the names more consistent.
- Added an Advect Points SOP.
- Added a Level Set Filter SOP that allows for unrestricted surface
  deformations, unlike the older Filter SOP, which restricts surface
  motion to the initial narrow band.
- Added staggered vector sampling to the Sample Points SOP.
- Added a minimum radius threshold to the particle voxelization tool
  and SOP.
- Merged the Composite and CSG SOPs into a single Combine SOP.
- Added a tool and a SOP to efficiently generate narrow-band level set
  representations of spheres.
- In the Visualize SOP, improved the performance of tree topology
  generation, which is now enabled by default.

  mesh voxelizer@endlink and improved the quality of inside/outside
  voxel classification.  Output grids are now also
  @vdblink::Grid::setGridClass() classified@endlink as either level sets
  or fog volumes.
- Modified the @vdblink::tools::GridResampler GridResampler@endlink
  to use the signed flood fill optimization only on grids that are
  tagged as level sets.

  math library and a method to return the
  @vdblink::math::Mat3::trace trace@endlink of a @c Mat3.
- Fixed a bug in the
  @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor::ValueAccessor(const ValueAccessor&)
  ValueAccessor@endlink copy constructor that caused the copy to reference

- Fixed a bug in @vdblink::tree::RootNode::setActiveState()
  RootNode::setActiveState@endlink that caused a crash
  when marking a (virtual) background voxel as inactive.
- Added a @c Tree::pruneLevelSet method that is similar to but faster than
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::pruneInactive() pruneInactive@endlink
  for level set grids.
- Added fast leaf node voxel access
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::getValue(Index) const methods@endlink
  that index by linear offset (as returned by
  @vdblink::tree::LeafNode::ValueOnIter::pos() ValueIter::pos@endlink)
  instead of by @ijk coordinates.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::Tree::touchLeaf() Tree::touchLeaf@endlink
  method that can be used to preallocate a static tree topology over which
  to safely perform multithreaded processing.
- Added a grain size argument to @c LeafArray for finer control of parallelism.
- Modified the Makefile to make it easier to omit the <TT>doc</TT>,
  @c vdb_test and @c vdb_view targets.
- Added utility functions (in <TT>houdini/UT_VDBUtils.h</TT>) to convert
  between Houdini and OpenVDB matrix and vector types.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- Added accessors to @c GEO_PrimVDB that make it easier to directly access
  voxel data and that are used by the HScript volume expression functions
  in Houdini 12.5.  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- As of Houdini 12.1.77, the native transform SOP operates on OpenVDB
  primitives.  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- Added a Convert SOP that converts OpenVDB grids to Houdini volumes
  and vice-versa.

- Fixed bugs in @vdblink::tree::RootNode RootNode@endlink and
  @vdblink::tree::InternalNode InternalNode@endlink @c setValue*() and
  @c fill() methods that could cause neighboring voxels to become inactive.
- Fixed a bug in
  @vdblink::tree::Tree::hasSameTopology() Tree::hasSameTopology@endlink
  that caused false positives when only active states and not values differed.
- Added a @vdblink::tree::Tree::hasActiveTiles() Tree::hasActiveTiles@endlink
  method.
- For better cross-platform consistency, substituted bitwise AND operations
  for right shifts in the @vdblink::tree::ValueAccessor ValueAccessor@endlink
  hash key computation.
- @c vdb_view no longer aborts when asked to surface a vector-valued
  grid&mdash;but it still doesn&rsquo;t render the surface.
- Made various changes for Visual C++ compatibility.
  <I>[Contributed by SESI]</I>
- Added an option to the MeshVoxelizer SOP to convert both open and
  closed surfaces to unsigned distance fields.
