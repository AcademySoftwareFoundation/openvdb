/// @brief Various transfer schemes for rasterizing point positions and radius
///  data to signed distance fields with optional closest point attribute
///  transfers. All methods support arbitrary target linear transformations,
///  fixed or varying point radius, filtering of point data and arbitrary types
///  for attribute transferring.
///
/// @details There are currently three main transfer implementations:
///
/// - Rasterize Spheres
///
///     Performs trivial narrow band stamping of spheres for each point. This
///     is an extremely fast and efficient way to produce both a valid
///     symmetrical narrow band level set and transfer attributes using closest
///     point lookups.
///
/// - Rasterize Smooth Spheres
///
///     Calculates an averaged position of influence per voxel as described in:
///       [Animating Sand as a Fluid - Zhu Bridson 2005].
///
///     This technique produces smoother, more blended connections between
///     points which is ideal for generating a more artistically pleasant
///     surface directly from point distributions. It aims to avoid typical
///     post filtering operations used to smooth surface volumes. Note however
///     that this method may not necessarily produce a *symmetrical* narrow
///     band level set; the exterior band may be smaller than desired depending
///     on the search radius - the surface can be rebuilt or resized if
///     necessary. The same closet point algorithm is used to transfer
///     attributes.
///
/// - Rasterize Ellipsoids.
///
///     Rasterizes anisotropic ellipses for each point by analyzing point
///     neighborhood distributions, as described in:
///       [Reconstructing Surfaces of Particle-Based Fluids Using Anisotropic
///        Kernel - Yu Turk 2010].
///
///     This method uses the rotation and affine matrix attributes built from
///     the points::pca() method which model these elliptical distributions
///     using principal component analysis. The ellipses create a much tighter,
///     more fitted surface that better represents the convex hull of the point
///     set. This technique also allows point to smoothly blend from their
///     computed ellipse back to a canonical sphere, as well as allowing
///     isolated points to be rasterized with their own radius scale. Although
///     the rasterization step of this pipeline is relatively fast, it is still
///     the slowest of all three methods and depends on the somewhat expensive
///     points::pca() method. Still, this technique can be far superior at
///     producing fluid surfaces where thin sheets (waterfalls) or sharp edges
///     (wave breaks) are desirable.
///
///
///  In general, it is recommended to consider post rebuilding/renormalizing
///  the generated surface using either tools::levelSetRebuild() or
///  tools::LevelSetTracker::normalize() tools::LevelSetTracker::resize().
///
/// @note These methods use the framework provided in PointTransfer.h
