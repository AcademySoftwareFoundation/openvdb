/// @brief Library and file format version numbers
///
/// @details
/// When the library is built with the latest ABI, its namespace has the form
/// <B>openvdb::vX_Y</B>, where @e X and @e Y are the major and minor version
/// numbers.
///
/// The library can be built using an older ABI by changing the value of the
/// @b OPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER. (e.g., via <TT>-DOPENVDB_ABI_VERSION_NUMBER=<I>N</I></TT>).
/// In that case, the namespace has the form <B>openvdb::vX_YabiN</B>,
/// where N is the ABI version number.
///
/// The ABI version must be set consistently when building code that depends on
/// OpenVDB.
///
/// The ABI version number defaults to the library major version number, which
/// gets incremented whenever changes are made to the ABI of the Grid class or
/// related classes (Tree, Transform, Metadata, etc.). Setting the ABI version
/// number to an earlier library version number disables grid ABI changes made
/// since that library version.
///
/// The library minor version number gets incremented whenever a change is made
/// to any aspect of the public API (not just the grid API) that necessitates
/// changes to client code.  Changes to APIs in private or internal namespaces
/// do not trigger a minor version number increment; such APIs should not be
/// used in client code.
///
/// A patch version number increment indicates a change&mdash;usually a new
/// feature or a bug fix&mdash;that does not necessitate changes to client code
/// but rather only recompilation of that code (because the library namespace
/// incorporates the version number).
///
/// The file format version number gets incremented when it becomes possible to
/// write files that cannot safely be read with older versions of the library.
/// Not all files written in a newer format are incompatible with older
/// libraries, however. And in general, files containing grids of unknown type
/// can be read safely, although the unknown grids will not be accessible.
