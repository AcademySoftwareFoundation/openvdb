@section vdbaxtoaxtypes OpenVDB / OpenVDB AX Types
@par
Whilst OpenVDB AX is primarily designed for OpenVDB, it has its own notion of
types. This is so that the actual AX language is able to support arithmetic that
OpenVDB geometry would perhaps otherwise not support. For example, AX supports
3x3 and 4x4 matrix types. These types are akin to the `openvdb::math::Mat` types
that exist in OpenVDB library - however, historically, these types are not
"registered Grid types" by default by OpenVDB. This means that, although you
could theoretically create an `openvdb::Mat3dGrid` OpenVDB may not support the
reading or writing of these grid types out the box. Whilst this may change in
the future, there may exist other examples of types in AX which suffer from the
same limitation of existing geometry types in OpenVDB.
@par
Native OpenVDB types are types which are @b a) registered for serialization and
@b b) compilable by the default C++ installation of OpenVDB. This is a bit
convoluted, so what does this actually mean in practice? Generally, accessing an
@b attribute in AX requires that data to exist on the underlying geometry. As
such, reading or writing to a given attribute (for example `bool@myattr`)
requires both the AX compiler @b and the underlying geometry to support the
given type. As mentioned above, there may be times where this isn't the case.
Consider the following:
@par
@code{.c}
vec4i a = {1,2,3,4};
vec4i@attr = a;
@endcode
@par
Now lets assume that a notion of four `int32` values is not supported for
serialization of OpenVDB points or volumes (we assume the type can at least be
instantiated). Whilst this code may execute, serializing this data to disk may
fail due to unregistered OpenVDB types. AX does @b not register any additional
OpenVDB types. This choice is left to downstream software. In this example, to
allow for serialization of `vec4` types, some variant of the following can be
implemented in your application.
@warning
The choice to register Grid types in OpenVDB is left to the OpenVDB maintainers.
There are important consequences to registering custom types - other default
installations of OpenVDB <b>will not be able to read your files</b> unless
compiled with similar instantiations.
@par
@code{.cpp}
openvdb::initialize(); // standard init of vdb
openvdb::ax::initialize(); // standard init of ax
// Define a Vec4I grid type from the openvdb::math::Vec4<int32_t> class.
// Use a ValueConverter to ensure the grid has the same configuration as
// a standard OpenVDB grid type.
using Vec4IGrid = openvdb::BoolGrid::ValueConverter<openvdb::Vec4I>::Type;
// register this type
Vec4IGrid::registerGrid();
@endcode
