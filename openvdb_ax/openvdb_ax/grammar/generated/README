This folder contains pre-generated grammar source and header files for
OpenVDB AX. The grammar can be re-generated by using the OpenVDB AX
CMake variable OPENVDB_BUILD_AX_GRAMMAR during the first run of CMake,
in which case these files are ignored in favour of the new files from
CMakes temporary build folder.
