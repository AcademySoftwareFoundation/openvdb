    "\n",
    "A `GridBatch` is an indexing structure which maps the 3D $ijk$ coordinates of a set of **sparse** grids to integer offsets which can be used to look up elements in a data tensor that correspond with each voxel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mapping only exists for $ijk$ coordinates which are **active** in the space of a **sparse**, 3D grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "&#x1F4A1; We call these 3D grids **sparse** because of this arbitrary nature to the topology of **active** voxels in the grid compared to **dense** grids where all voxels exist inside some regular extents in each dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below illustrates this $ijk$ mapping process for a `GridBatch` containing only a single grid.\n",

    "&#x1F529;\tAt the level of technical implementation, these 3D grids are [**NanoVDB**](https://academysoftwarefoundation.github.io/openvdb/NanoVDB_MainPage.html) grids of the special `IndexGrid` type which only stores a unique **index** integer value at each active voxel location.  This **index** is an offset into some external data array, a tensor, (one that is not contained in the `IndexGrid`/`GridBatch` classes) where contiguous array members correspond to spatially nearby voxels.  `IndexGrid` will allow us to reference into this 'sidecar' tensor of data given a spatial $ijk$ set of coordinates.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To help explain these concepts, let's consider how we might treat image data with this framework (an image can be thought of as a dense 2D grid after all).  \n",
    "\n",
    "If an image is a 2D grid of pixels, we could imagine the position of each pixel could be expressed as $i,j$ coordinates.  For an RGB image, each pixel would contain 3 associated values $(R,G,B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we could decompose an image into:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  an `IndexGrid` of $i,j$ coordinates\n",
    "2.  a tensor of size $[NumberPixels, 3]$ (the flattened RGB elements for our data tensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "The $i,j$ coordinates can be used with the `IndexGrid` to index into the list of RGB values to retrieve the RGB element for each pixel.  In our nomenclature, we'd say our data has element size 3 (RGB) and the number of elements in our data tensor is equal to the number of pixels in the image (in the illustration below the number of elements is 16).\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/image_index_grid_diagram.svg\"  alt=\"Image Index Grid\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had a batch of *many* images, each of different sizes, we can imagine constructing a `GridBatch` as an ordered set of their `IndexGrid`s.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the RGB elements would go into a sidecar data tensor where each array of data would have to be of a different length corresponding to the image size.  We call this list of different-length element data a **jagged tensor**.\n",

    "Lastly, it is important to know that each grid in the `GridBatch` will be on the same device and processed together by operators in mini-batch-like fashion.  \n",
