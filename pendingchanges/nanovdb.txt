Added support for multiple GPUs to DeviceBuffer
Added a UnifiedBuffer class that wraps CUDA unified memory
Added example for multiGPU sparse convolution
Added CUDA utility functions for device queries
Added functions to independently stop and compute the elapsed time for timer classes

Fixed ostream specializations being hidden within the nanovdb namespace
Replaced CUB's CachingDeviceAllocator with the default asynchronous stream ordered allocator in PointsToGrid for improved performance

Fixed offset bug in nanovdb::tools::cuda::IndexToGrid related to non-POD build types (contributed by Andreas Henne)
