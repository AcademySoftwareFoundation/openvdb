Added nanovdb::openToIndexVDB, which can convert an OpenVDB grid into a NanoVDB IndexGrid.
Added new options "--index" and "--onIndex" to the command-line tool nanovdb_convert so it can produce IndexGrids 
Added support for multiple GPUs to DeviceBuffer
Added a UnifiedBuffer class that wraps CUDA unified memory
Added example for multiGPU sparse convolution
Added CUDA utility functions for device queries
Added functions to independently stop and compute the elapsed time for timer classes

Fixed ostream specializations being hidden within the nanovdb namespace
Replaced CUB's CachingDeviceAllocator with the default asynchronous stream ordered allocator in PointsToGrid for improved performance
