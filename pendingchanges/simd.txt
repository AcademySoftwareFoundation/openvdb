OpenVDB:
    New Features:
        - OpenVDB now includes a copy of Agner Fog's VectorClass Library (VCL)
        for the use of generically wrapped SIMD intrinsics throughout the core
        library. VCL supports intel ISA up to AVX512. This support is OFF by
        default but can be enabled with USE_VCL=ON.

        - PointTransfer algorithms have been instrumented with SIMD instructions
        which result in significantly improved performance of anywhere up from
        2x to 4x. This includes all PCA and Point Rasterize methods (except for
        Ellipsoids).

    Improvements:
        - The PointTransfer framework now allows transfer schemes to set a power
        of two Batch Size for bucket rasterizing. This results in improved
        performance for PCA and all PointRasterize methods, even without the use
        of VCL/SIMD intrinsics.
