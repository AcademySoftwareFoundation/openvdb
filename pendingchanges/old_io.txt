- Support for reading .vdb files written prior to VDB 1.0 has been removed.
  To read older .vdb files, please use VDB 12.x or older and re-write them,
  so that they use the newer file format and can be read in VDB 13+.

API changes:
 - LegacyFrustum and RootNodeMask have been removed. These classes were only
   used for reading old .vdb files, which is no longer supported.
