OpenVDB AX:
 - Improvements:
   - Added support for LLVM versions greater than 15. Upgraded CI to test with
     LLVM versions 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20.
   - As of this release, LLVM 15 is the minimum required version for OpenVDB AX.
     Note that there is an issue with LLVM 17 symbols which makes it incompatible
     with the OpenVDB Python plugin. AS such, LLVM version 18 and greater are
     the recommended LLVM versions to use, with LLVM 18 being the new future
     minimum version.
   - Significant performance improvement to the compilation of AX kernels when
     using LLVM 18 and greater.
   - Significant backend refactoring to AX IR generation to support newer 
     versions of LLVM. In particular, parts of the codegen::Function and 
     codegen::FunctionBuilder API require new usage from LLVM 16 due to
     the LLVM opaque pointer changes. If you're not using the OpenVDB AX
     Function codegen API then no client changes should be necessary.
   - Migrated OpenVDB AX unit tests from cppunit to gtest

 - Fixes:
  - Fixed a case of undefined behaviour when explicitly casting variables to
    the same type as their storage type e.g:
      double a; double b = double(a);
  - Fixed an AX compiler error which would produce invalid IR when using 64bit
    integer variables for matrix array offsetting e.g:
       int64 a = 0; mat4f b = 1; float c = b[a,a];
