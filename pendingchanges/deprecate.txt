API changes:
- Removed Grid::evalMinMax(), use tools::minMax for superior threaded performance.
- Removed points::rasterize() that took a custom filter and interrupter.
- Removed LeafNode<bool, ...>() TopologyCopy constructor in favor of using explicit
  mask/buffer constructors.
- Removed ValueAccessor NodeT0, NodeT1, NodeT2 aliases, use NodeTypeAtLevel instead.

Houdini:
  Improvements:
    - Remove support for openvdb_houdini::Interrupter, use
      openvdb_houdini::HoudiniInterrupter instead.
    - Remove input-stealing via duplicateSourceStealable(), SideFX have since
      introduced verbification and compiled SOPs to provide zero-copy node evaluation.
