OpenVDB:
  New features:
    - Added customization of the output transformation attribute for points::pca(). 
      Can be output as a quaternion or as a combined affine transform with the 
      scale/stretch ommitted.
    - Added support for input quaternions attributes and affine transformations
      (that include scale) in points::rasterizeSdf() for ellipsoidal rasterizations.
