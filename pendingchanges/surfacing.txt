OpenVDB:
    New:
        - Introduced anisotropic surfacing tools in points/PointRasterizeSDF.h
        and principle component analysis (PCA) methods in points/PrincipleComponentAnalysis.h.
        The latter tool analyses point neighborhoods and computes affine
        transformations representing elliptical distributions. The prior tool
        takes rotational and stretch point attributes (optionally computed from
        the prior PCA methods) and generates anisotropic surfaces.

    API Changes:
        - Re-worked the API in PointRasterizeSDF.h with the addition of anisotropic
        surfacing kernels. The new API exposes more concise free functions which
        take structs of parameters. The old API remains supported but is
        deprecated.

    Improvements:
        - Improved the performance of PointRasterizeSDF.h tools with larger radii
        with better bound computation approximations.

    Fixes:
        - Fixed a bug in points::rasterizeSpheres and points::rasterizeSmoothSpheres
        which could cause sections of the generated surface to incorrectly be marked
        as negative interior values.
        - Fixed some precision issues in various Matrix methods
