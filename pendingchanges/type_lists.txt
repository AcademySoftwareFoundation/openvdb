New Features:
    - Exposed TypeList declarations in openvdb.h which denote the default set of types supported by OpenVDB.

Improvements:
    - Added a new foreach method to TypeList for iterating over types without constructing them.
    - Added TypeList::Transform declaration for transforming TypeLists into new types.
    - Moved Grid::apply implementation to TypeList::apply to allow for other polymorphic types to invoke it.

Bug Fixes:
    - Fixed an issue which could result in significant compilation times when instantiating TypeList<>::Unique<>
