OpenVDB:
      openvdb/tools/MeshToVolume's meshToVolume takes two
      new optional arguments to provide an interior test oracle and an
      interior testing methods.  These allow the default
      outside-flood-fill to be replaced if the actual sidedness can be
      known.  Thanks to Tomas Skrivan for this change.

      LevelSetRebuild includes disabled code that uses this for
      resampling levelsets - the original grid is used as the true
      sign value.  However, due to differences between
      polygonalization and trilinear interpolation, it cannot be used
      directly.  The code is provided so we can learn from this
      mistake.
   
Houdini:
    - Added Preserve Holes option to VDB From Polygons that uses the
      fast winding oracle to not collapse holes in polygonal geometry.
