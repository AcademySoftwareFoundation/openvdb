"""Write a VDB file to disk."""

The OpenVDB Write SOP writes VDB grids to a file with the option to specify various compression types. This node is typically used for debugging, otherwise relying on Houdini's native Geometry ROP is usually preferable.

@parameters

File Name:
    Path name for the output VDB file.

Group:
	Write only a subset of the input grids.

Compression:
	Blosc is fast and compresses well. Zip is slow but compresses very well. For most cases Blosc is the recommended compression type.

Write Mode:
	In Manual mode, click the Write Now button to write the output file. In Automatic mode, the file is written each time this node cooks.

Write Now:
	Click this button to force writing when in Manual mode.

== Float Precision ==

Write 16-Bit:
	For grids that belong to the group(s) listed here, write floating-point scalar or vector voxel values using 16-bit half floats. If no groups are listed, all grids will be written using their existing precision settings.

Write Full-Precision:
	For grids that belong to the group(s) listed here, write floating-point scalar or vector voxel values using full-precision floats or doubles. If no groups are listed, all grids will be written using their existing precision settings.
