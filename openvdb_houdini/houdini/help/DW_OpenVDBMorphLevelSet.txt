= OpenVDB Morph Level Set =

"""Blends between source and target level set VDBs."""


The OpenVDB Morph Level Set operation will advect a source narrow band signed distance field towards a target narrow band signed distance field.

[Include:volume_types]

@parameters

Source Level Set:
    The source VDB primitive to blend. It must be an narrow band signed distance field from the first input.

Target Level Set:
    The target VDB primitive to blend. It must be an narrow band signed distance field from the second input.

Alpha Mask:
    If enabled, it will use the third input's VDB for alpha masking. Assumes
    voxel values are between 0 to 1 inclusive.

== Morphing ==

These control how the SDF is moved from the source to the target.

Time Step:
    Number of seconds of movement to apply to the input points.
    The default is `1/$FPS` (one frame's worth of time).

    TIP:
        This parameter can be animated through time using the `$T`
        expression. To control how fast the morphing is done, multiply `$T`
        by a scale factor. For example, to animate it twice as fast, use
        the expression, `$T*2`.

Spatial Scheme:
    How accurately the gradients of the signed distance field are computed.
    The later choices are more accurate but take more time.

Temporal Scheme:
    How accurately time is evolved within the timestep.  Later choices are
    more accurate but take more time.

== Renormalization ==

After morphing the signed distance field, it will often no longer be a proper signed distance field.  A number of renormalizaton passes can be performed to convert it back into a proper field.

Steps:
        The number of times to renormalize between every substep.
Spatial Scheme:
        How accurately the gradients of the signed distance field are computed. The later choices are more accurate but take more time.
Temporal Scheme:
        How accurately time is evolved within the renormalizaton stage.  Later choices are more accurate but take more time.
