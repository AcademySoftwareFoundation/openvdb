= OpenVDB Topology to Level Set =

"""Creates a Level Set VDB based on the active set of another VDB."""


The OpenVDB Topology to Level Set node creates a level set VDB which wraps the active
set of the reference VDB.  This forms a shell or wrapper that can be used
to conservatively enclose the referenced VDB.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    The VDBs to consider for conversion.


Output Name:
    #id: outputname

    The pattern used to generate new names from the input VDBs.

Custom Name:
    #id: customname

    The unique name used either for the new VDB, or as the suffix.


Use World Space for Band:
    #id: worldspaceunits

    The generated SDF can have its bandwidth provided in voxels or in SOP space.


Half-Band in Voxels:
    #id: bandwidth

    Specifies the bandwidth in voxel space.  This is most efficient as it will work with all scales of geometry.  3 voxels is optimal for many level set operations.


Half-Band in World:
    #id: bandwidthws

    The halfband of the SDF measured in SOP space.

Voxel Dilation:
    #id: dilation

    Expands the filled voxel region by the specified number of voxels.  This will provide this much additional padding.

Closing Width:
    #id: closingwidth

    First expand the filled voxel region, then shrink it by the specified number of voxels. This causes holes and valleys to be filled.


Smoothing Steps:
    #id: smoothingsteps

    Number of smoothing iterations.
