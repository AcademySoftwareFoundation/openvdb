"""Read a VDB file from disk."""

The OpenVDB Read SOP reads VDB grids from a file. Unlike the file SOP, there is the ability to use OpenVDB's native delayed-loading.

@parameters

Read Metadata Only:
    If enabled, output empty grids populated with their metadata and transforms only.

Clip to Reference Bounds:
    If enabled, clip grids to the bounding box of the reference geometry.

File Name:
    Specify a VDB file.

Grid(s):
    Grid names separated by white space (wildcards allowed).

Group:
    If enabled, create a group with the given name that comprises the selected grids. If disabled, do not group the selected grids.

Missing Frame:
    If the specified file does not exist on disk, either report an error (Report Error) or warn and continue (No Geometry).

Reload File:
    Reread the VDB file.

Delay Loading:
    If enabled, don't allocate memory for or read voxel or attribute values until the values are actually accessed. Delayed loading can significantly lower memory usage, but note that viewport visualization of a volume usually requires the entire volume to be loaded into memory.

Copy if smaller than:
    When delayed loading is enabled, a file must not be modified on disk before it has been fully read. For safety, files smaller than the given size (in GB) will be copied to a private, temporary location (either $OPENVDB_TEMP_DIR, $TMPDIR or a system default temp directory).
