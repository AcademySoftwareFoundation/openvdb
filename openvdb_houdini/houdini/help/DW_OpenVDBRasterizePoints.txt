"""Rasterize points into density and attribute grids."""

The OpenVDB Rasterize Points SOP rasterizes points into density and attribute grids. It has a accompanying creation script that adds a default VOP subnetwork and UI parameters for cloud and velocity field modeling.

@parameters

Point Group:
    A group of points to rasterize.

Transform VDB:
    VDB grid that defines the output transform.

Mask VDB:
    VDB grid whose active topology defines what region to rasterize into.

Invert Mask:
    Toggle to rasterize in the region outside the mask.

Voxel Size:
    Uniform voxel edge length in world units. Decrease the voxel size to increase the volume resolution.

Frustum Quality:
    1 is the standard quality and fast. 10 is the highest quality where everything is rasterized at the frustum near-plane resolution and filtered down to frustum resolution which can be slow.

Clip to Frustum:
    When using a frustum transform only rasterize data inside the frustum region.

Create Density Volume:
    Toggle to enable or disable the density volume generation. Attribute volumes are still constructed as usual.

Density Merge:
    How to blend point densities in the density volume. Accumulate or Maximum.

Density Scale:
    The density attribute will be scaled by this. If there is no density, 1 will be used as the reference.

Particle Scale:
    The pscale point attribute, which defines the world space particle radius, will be scaled by this.  A value of one is assumed if the pscale attribute is missing.

Solid Ratio:
    The amount of the particle that gets full density. 0 means only the very center of the particle will have full density. 1 means the entire particle out to the pscale will have full density.

Attributes:
    List of (float or vector) point attributes that will be rasterized using weighted average blending.

Enable VEX Processing:
    Use the contained VOP network to define a VEX procedure that determines density and attribute values. See the embedded VOP network for further details.

Export Point Mask:
    Output the point mask used in the rasterization operation.
