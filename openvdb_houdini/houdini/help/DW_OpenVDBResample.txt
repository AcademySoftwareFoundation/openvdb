"""Re-samples a VDB volume primitive into a new orientation and/or voxel size."""

[Include:volume_types]

NOTE:
    This node does not filter the results.
    If you change the resolution you may get aliasing artifacts.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of the VDB volume primitives in the input to be re-sampled.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

[Include:vdbfrompolygons#group]

Interpolation Order:
    How to interpolate positions.

    Nearest neighbor:
        Choose the value from the nearest voxel.
        This is fast but can cause aliasing artifacts.

    Tri-linear:
        Matches what [Volume Mix|Node:sop/volumemix] and [Vex:volumesample] do.

    Tri-quadratic:
        Smoother than tri-linear, but slower.

Define Transform:
    How to generate the new VDB's transform.

    Explicitly:
        Use the values in the transform parameters below.

    To Match Reference VDB:
        Use the transform and voxel size from a VDB in this node's second input.
        The result is a copy of the first input, aligned to the second input.

    Using Voxel Size Only:
        Keep the transform of the input VDB, only changing the voxel size.
        This is useful for increasing or decreasing the resolution.

        This will result in an aliased grid since no filtering is done.

    Using Voxel Scale Only:
	Same as "Using Voxel Size Only" except that the new voxel size is
	specified as a scale factor.

Transform Order:
    When __Define transform__ is "Explicitly", the order of operations for the new transform.

Rotate Order:
    When __Define transform__ is "Explicitly", the order of rotations for the new transform.

Translate:
    When __Define transform__ is "Explicitly", the position for the new transform.

Rotate:
    When __Define transform__ is "Explicitly", the rotation for the new transform.

Scale:
    When __Define transform__ is "Explicitly", the scale for the new transform.

Pivot:
    When __Define transform__ is "Explicitly", the pivot point for the new transform.

Voxel Size:
    The size of voxels in the new VDB. Larger voxels correspond to lower resolution.

    NOTE:
        This parameter is only visible when __Define transform__ is __Using voxel size only__.

Voxel Scale:
    The amount by which to scale the voxel size in the new VDB. Larger voxels correspond to lower resolution.

    NOTE:
        This parameter is only visible when __Define transform__ is __Using voxel scale only__.

Transform Vectors:
    When __Define transform__ is "Explicitly", apply the transform to the voxel
    values of vector-valued VDBs according to its Vector Type.

Rebuild SDF:
    Transforming (especially scaling) a SDF might invalidate signed distances,
    necessitating its reconstruction.  This option affects only SDF volumes,
    and it should almost always be enabled for those cases.

Prune Tolerance:
    Remove voxels within this distance of the VDB primitive's "background" (empty) value.
    This is necessary since the resampling can create active but "empty" voxels.

    In general, you should leave this option on.
    Expert users may want to turn this off based on very specific situations.
    For example, if you know that pruning empty voxels is a waste of time since a later operation will reactivate many of them.
