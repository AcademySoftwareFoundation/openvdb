= OpenVDB To Spheres =

"""Fills a VDB volume with adaptively-sized spheres."""

This node is useful for generating proxy geometry for RBD simulations since
converting non convex polygons into sphere compounds drastically improves the
simulation time. This can be used for example, on the output of a
[OpenVDB Fracture SOP|Node:sop/DW_OpenVDBFracture].

It is also useful for cloud modeling, to produce the initial density volume.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of VDB primitives to fill. See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group] for more information.

Isovalue:
    The crossing point of the VDB values that is considered the surface.  A value of `0` works for signed distance fields, and `0.5` is a better choice for fog VDBs.

Use World Space Units:
	If enabled, the min and max radius is specified in world-space units.

Min Radius in Voxels:
    Determines the smallest sphere size in voxel units.

Max Radius in Voxels:
    Determines the largest sphere size in voxel units.

Max Spheres:
    No more than this number of spheres are generated per VDB primitive.

Scatter Points:
    Maximum number of interior points to consider for the sphere placement. Increasing this count increases the chances of finding optimal sphere sizes.

Overlapping:
    When enabled, spheres will be allowed to overlap/intersect.

Preserve Attributes and Groups:
    Enable to copy attributes and groups from the input.

Add ID Attribute:
    Enable to add an `id` point attribute that corresponds to different VDBs.

Add PScale Attribute:
    Enable to add a `pscale` point attribute that corresponds to the radius of each sphere.
