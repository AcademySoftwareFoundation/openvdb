@parameters

Group:
    The name for this group of grids.

Transform:
    The method to use for the VDB transform.

Linear Transform:

    Voxel Size:
        The size (length of a side) of the cubic voxels, in Houdini units.

    Rotation:
        Rotation specified in ZYX order.

Frustum Transform:

    Preview:
        Preview the camera frustum.

    Camera:
        The path to the camera object to align the VDB to, for example /obj/cam1.

    Near/far planes:
        The distance in Houdini units, from the camera to the near/far side of the frustum used to calculate voxel size.

    Voxel Count:
        Horizontal voxel count for the near plane.

    Voxel Depth Size:
        The voxel depth (uniform z-size) in world units.

    Camera Offset:
        Adds padding to the view frustum without changing the near and far plane positions. Offsets the camera position in the reversed view direction.

Reference VDB Transform:

    Reference:
        Select the grid to be used as reference. If multiple grids are selected, then the first one will be used.

    Match Voxel Size:
        When enabled, use the same voxel size as the reference VDB.

    Voxel Size:
        Uniform voxel size in world units.

    Match Topology:
        When enabled, use the same topology as the reference VDB.

== Grids ==

Grid Class:
    The semantic meaning of the volume.  This controls how the raw volume
    values are interpreted.  Certain VDB tools operate on certain
    types of volumes, such as level sets, and use the class to help
    determine how to treat their inputs.

    Other:
        No special meaning is assigned to the volume's data.

    Level Set:
        The volume is treated as a narrow-band signed distance field
        level set.  The values are expected to define positive and negative
        distances to a surface field up to a certain bandwidth.

    Fog Volume:
        The volume represents a density field.  Values should be
        positive with zero representing empty regions.

    Staggered Vector Field:
        The volume's vector values are to be treated as lying on
        the faces of the respective cells, not the centers.

Type:
    The datatype to store in the voxels. VDB allows true vectors at each voxel, while standard Houdini volumes use three scalar volumes to do the same thing.

Grid Name:
    The value for the primitive's `name` attribute.
    This is useful for referring to the primitive in later nodes, using the `@name=foo` syntax.

Background Value:
    The "default" value for any voxel not explicitly set.
    Voxels with this value use essentially no memory.
