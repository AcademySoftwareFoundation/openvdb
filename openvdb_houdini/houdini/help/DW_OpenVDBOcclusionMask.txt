= OpenVDB Occlusion Mask =

"""Create a mask of the voxels in shadow from a camera for VDB primitives."""

This node creates a mask of the voxels inside a camera frustum that are
occluded by the objects in the input VDB primitives.

@parameters

Group:
    Name(s) of the VDB primitives to operate on. If empty, all VDBs are
    used. See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Camera:
    Path of the camera object to use as the frustum (ie /obj/cam1).

Voxel Count:
    Horizontal voxel count on the camera's near plane.

Voxel Depth Size:
    Voxel depth (uniform z-size) in Houdini units.

Mask Depth:
    Depth in Houdini units from the near plane to for the created mask.

Erode:
    Number of iterations to shrink the resulting mask.

Z Offset:
    Number of voxels to offset the near plane from which shadow voxels are
    created.

Clip to Frustum:
	Clip the occlusion mask to the frustum during generation, resulting in a smaller memory footprint and faster performance.
