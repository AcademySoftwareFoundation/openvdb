"""Generate a platonic solid as a level set or fog volume VDB."""

The OpenVDB Platonic SOP generates a VDB representing a platonic solid as either a level set or fog volume.

@parameters

Solid Type:
    Choose from a sphere or one of the five platonic solids.

Grid Class:
    The type of level set to generate.

    Level Set:
        The volume is treated as a narrow-band signed distance field
        level set.  The values are expected to define positive and negative
        distances to a surface field up to a certain bandwidth.

    Signed Distance Field:
        The volume is treated as a narrow-band unsigned distance field
        level set.  The values are expected to define positive distances
        to a surface field up to a certain bandwidth.

Radius/Size:
    The size of the platonic solid or radius in the case of a sphere.

Center:
    The world-space center of the level set.

Voxel Size:
    The voxel-size of the level set.

Half-band Width:
    Desired radius in voxel units around the surface (zeroth level set).
    For proper operation, many nodes expect that half-width is at least 3.

Convert to fog volume:
    When enabled, generate a fog volume instead of a level set.
