"""Replaces a VDB volume with geometry that visualizes its structure."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node may be useful to experts for checking if the VDB volume is wasting memory.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of VDB primitives in the input to visualize.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

== Surfacing ==

Mesher:
    Select a meshing scheme.

Adaptivity:
    Specify surface adaptivity.

Isovalue:
    Specify the value of the isosurface.

Surface Color:
    The color of the surface.

== Tree Topology ==

Color:
    Specify whether to draw in color (which adds the `Cd` attribute).

Frustrum:
    For VDB primitives created based on a frustum, draw the corresponding frustum bounding box.
    See the __Frustum__ and __From camera__ modes of the [OpenVDB Create SOP|Node:sop/DW_OpenVDBCreate].

Leaf Nodes:
    When enabled, it will draw leaf nodes with the specified method.
    If __Color__ is enabled, they are drawn in blue.

    Wireframe Boxes:
	    Draw as wireframe boxes.
    Solid Boxes:
        Draw as solid boxes.

Internal Nodes:
    When enabled, it will draw non-leaf nodes with the specified method.
    If `Color` is enabled, the first internal node level is shown in green,
    otherwise shown in orange.

    Wireframe Boxes:
        Draw as wireframe boxes.
    Solid Boxes:
        Draw as solid boxes.

Active Tiles:
    When enabled, draw nodes that are active but hold the default (empty) value in the specified method.
    Positive values are red, negative values are white.

    Points:
        Draw a single point in the middle of each node.
    Wireframe Boxes:
	    Draw as wireframe boxes.
    Solid Boxes:
        Draw as solid boxes.

Active Voxels:
    When enabled, draw active voxels in the specified method.
    They are colored red if positive valued, white if negative valued.

    Points:
        Draw a single point in the middle of each voxel.
    Wireframe Boxes:
	    Draw as wireframe boxes.
    Solid Boxes:
        Draw as solid boxes.

Ignore Staggered Vectors:
    Draw staggered vectors as if they were collocated.

Points with Index Coordinates:
    Add a voxel/tile index coordinate attribute to points.

Points with Values:
    Add a voxel/tile value attribute to points.

Name Point Attributes After Grids:
    When enabled, name the attribute added by __Points with Values__ the same as
    its VDB grid name.  If disabled or if a VDB grid has no name, the point
    attributes will named according to their type such as `vdb_int`,
    `vdb_float`, or `vdb_vec3f`.
