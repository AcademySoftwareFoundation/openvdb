= OpenVDB Smooth Level Set =

"""Smooths out level set values in a VDB volume primitive."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node applies a simulated flow operation, moving the surface of the signed distance field according to some local property.

For example, if you move along the normal by an amount dependent on the
curvature, you will flatten out dimples and hills and leave flat areas
unchanged.

Unlike the smoothing options in the [OpenVDB Filter SOP|Node:sop/DW_OpenVDBFilter], this node ensure the level set remains a valid signed-distance field.

@parameters

Group:
    The VDB primitives to be smoothed.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group] for more information.

[Include:vdbsmooth#maskname]

Operation:
    What sort of smoothing process to apply to the VDB.

    Mean Value:
        Find the mean (`total/count`) of the surrounding values.
        This is equivalent to a box blur of the same radius.

    Median Value:
        Find the median (middle value) of the surrounding values.
        This is useful for de-spiking noisy data as extreme values will not contribute to the final result.

    Mean Curvature Flow:
        Finds the average curvature at each location.
        Moves the surface along the local surface normal to flatten out bumps.

    Laplacian Flow:
        Finds the local "Laplacian" to control how much to move along
        the normal.

Use World Space Units:
    Sets whether the `Radius` amount is specified in Houdini units. When this
    option is off, the amount is interpreted as voxels.

[Include:vdbsmooth#radius]

Iterations:
    Number of times to repeat the smoothing operation.

[Include:vdbsmooth#invert]

[Include:vdbsmooth#minmask]

[Include:vdbsmooth#maxmask]
