"""Tests VDBs for Bad Values and Repairs."""

The OpenVDB Diagnostics node has a suite of tests to validate and correct common errors in OpenVDB nodes.  For most errors, it provides an option of marking the troublesome voxels and/or repairing them.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    Which input VDBs to examine.


Mark in Mask Grid:
    #id: usemask

    For tests set to Mark, output a mask VDB that highlights problematic regions in input VDBs.

Mark as Points With Values:
    #id: usepoints

    For tests set to Mark, output a point cloud that highlights problematic regions in input VDBs.


Respect Grid Class:
    #id: respectclass

    If disabled, apply fog volume and level set tests to all VDBs, not just VDBs classified as fog volumes or level sets.

Validate Fog Volumes:
    #id: verify_fogvolume

    Verify that VDBs classified as fog volumes are valid fog volumes.

Validate for SDF CSG and Fracture:
    #id: verify_csg

    Verify that SDF VDBs meet the requirements for CSG and fracture operations.

Validate for SDF Filtering and Renormalization:
    #id: verify_filtering

    Verify that SDF VDBs meet the requirements for filtering and renormalization.

Validate for SDF Advection and Morphing:
    #id: verify_advection

    Verify that SDF VDBs meet the requirements for advection and morphing.

== General Tests ==

Finite Values:
    #id: test_finite

    Verify that all values are finite and non-NaN.

Uniform Background:
    #id: test_background

    Verify that all inactive voxels are set to the background value.

Values in Range:
    #id: test_valrange

    Verify that all scalar voxel values and vector magnitudes are in the given range.

== Level Set Tests ==

Range:
    #id: valrange

    Minimum and maximum allowed values (inclusive)

Symmetric Narrow Band:
    #id: test_symmetric

    Verify that SDF inside and outside values are of equal magnitude.

Minimum Band Width:
    #id: test_bandwidth

    Verify that interior and exterior narrow band widths are sufficiently large.

Closed Surface:
    #id: test_surface

    Verify that SDFs represent watertight surfaces.

Gradient Magnitude:
    #id: test_gradient

    Verify that the SDF gradient has magnitude one everywhere (within a given tolerance).

Inactive Tiles:
    #id: test_activetiles

    Verify that SDFs have no active tiles. These would represent constant regions that should not occur in an SDF.


Uniform Voxel Size:
    #id: test_voxelsize

    Verify that SDFs have uniform voxel sizes.

== Fog Volume Tests ==

Background Zero:
    #id: test_backgroundzero

    Verify that all inactive voxels in fog volumes have value zero.

Active Values in `[0, 1]`:
    #id: test_fogvalues

    Verify that all active voxels in fog volumes have values in the range `[0, 1]`.
