= OpenVDB Renormalize Level Set =

"""Fixes level sets stored in VDB volume primitives."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node iteratively adjusts the voxel values to properly respect the distance to the zero crossing line.
This requires proper signed distance values for the results to be meaningful.

NOTE:
    If you have significant departures from a proper signed distance field, you can rebuild it with the [OpenVDB From Polygons node|Node:sop/DW_OpenVDBFromPolygons].
    That node will implicitly convert an input level set to polygons, then convert the polygons back to an level set.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of the VDB volume primitives in the input to be normalized.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Iterations:
    The number of rounds of renormalization that should be performed.  More rounds are slower but will result in a more correct level set.

Renorm Accuracy:
    #id: accuracy

    The method for smoothing the level set after each iteration.
    Later options in the list are slower but more accurate.

Verbose:
    Prints the sequence of operations to the terminal.
