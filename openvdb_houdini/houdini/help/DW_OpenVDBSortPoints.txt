"""Re-order points into spatially-organised bins."""

The OpenVDB Sort Points SOP re-organises Houdini points so that they are ordered to correspond with three-dimensional spatial bins. This is done to improve performance of algorithms that rely on neighboring access (such as rasterization) where random access into an un-organized linear array would otherwise result in lower performance due to CPU cache effects.

@parameters

Point Group:
    #id: group

    Specify a subset of the input VDB grids to be sorted.

Bin Size:
    The size (length of a side) of the cubic bin, in world units.
