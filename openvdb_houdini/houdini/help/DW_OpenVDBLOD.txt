"""Build an LOD Pyramid from a VDB."""

The OpenVDB LOD SOP can build multiple filtered versions of a VDB grid,
providing different levels of detail.  This allows making a MIPMAP-like
representation.  The low resolution versions both can be used as thumbnails
for fast processing, but also can speed up filtered lookups by providing
large volume averages in constant time.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    Which of the input VDBs to process.


LOD Mode:
    #id: lod

    How to build the LOD pyramid.

    Single Level:
	Build a single filtered VDB.

    Level Range:
	Build a series of VDBs of successive refinement within a provided range.

    LOD Pyramid:
	Build a standard pyramid of VDBs of decreasing resolution.


Level:
    #id: level

    Specify which level to produce.   Level 0 is the highest-resolution level.

Range:
    #id: range

    Specify the inclusive range `[start, end, step]`

Count:
    #id: count
    Number of levels to generate.  Each level is half the resolution of the previous level.


Preserve Grid Names:
    #id: reuse

    Reuse the name of the input VDB grid.  Only available when a single Level is generated.
