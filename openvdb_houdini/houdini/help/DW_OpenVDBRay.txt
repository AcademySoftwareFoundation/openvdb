= OpenVDB Ray =

"""Projects geometry onto a level set VDB."""

Performs geometry projections using level set ray intersections or closest point queries.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    Which of the input VDBs to process.

Method:
    Specify the projection method. Either ray intersection or closest surface point.

Isovalue:
    The crossing point of the VDB values that is considered the surface. The zero default value works for signed distance fields while fog volumes require a larger positive value, 0.5 is a good initial guess.

Transform:
    If enabled, transform the intersected geometry.

Scale:
    Specify the amount with which to scale the intersected geometry.

Store Distances:
    Creates a point attribute for the distance to the collision surface or the closest surface point.

Intersect Farthest Surface:
    The farthest intersection point is used instead of the closest.

Reverse Rays:
    Make rays fire in the direction opposite to the normals.

Bias:
    Offsets the starting position of the rays.

Ray Hit Group:
    If enabled, create a point group to hold all successful intersections.
