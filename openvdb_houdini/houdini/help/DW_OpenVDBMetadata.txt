= OpenVDB Metadata =

"""Modify the metadata attached to a VDB."""

The OpenVDB Metadata SOP can create and edit the metadata attached to a VDB grid.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    Which of the input VDBs to process.

Class:
    The semantic meaning of the volume.  This controls how the raw volume
    values are interpreted.  Certain VDB tools operate on certain
    types of volumes, such as level sets, and use the class to help
    determine how to treat their inputs.

    Other:
        No special meaning is assigned to the volume's data.

    Level Set:
        The volume is treated as a narrow-band signed distance field
        level set.  The values are expected to define positive and negative
        distances to a surface field up to a certain bandwidth.

    Fog Volume:
        The volume represents a density field.  Values should be
        positive with zero representing empty regions.

    Staggered Vector Field:
        The volume's vector values are to be treated as lying on
        the faces of the respective cells, not the centers.

Creator:
    Specify who created the grid.

Transform Values:
    For vector-valued grids, specify whether voxel values are in world space
    and should be affected by transforms or in local space and should not be
    transformed.

[Include:primitive#vdbvectortype]

Write 16-Bit Floats:
    When saving the grid to a file, write floating-point scalar or vector
    voxel values as 16-bit half floats.
