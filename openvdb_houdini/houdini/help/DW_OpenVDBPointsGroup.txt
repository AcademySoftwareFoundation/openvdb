= OpenVDB Points Group =

"""Manipulates the Internal Groups of a VDB Points Primitive."""

The OpenVDB Points Group SOP acts as a Group SOP for the points inside
of a VDB Points primitive.  It can create an manipulate these internal
groups.  The generated group can then be used to selectively unpack
a subset of the points in a later [OpenVDB Points Convert|Node:sop/DW_OpenVDBPointsConvert].

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    VDB Points primitives to alter the groups within.


VDB Points Group:
    #id: vdbpointsgroup

    Specify an existing internal group in the VDB Points primitive to
    use as a starting point for creating a new group.

== Create ==

Enable:
    #id: enablecreate

    Enable creation of the group.


Group Name:
    #id: groupname

    The name of the internal group to create.


=== Number ===

Enable:
    #id: enablenumber

    Enable filtering by number.


Mode:
    #id: numbermode

    How to filter out a subset of the points inside the VDB Points.

Percent:
    #id: pointpercent

    What percentage of points to include in the group.


Count:
    #id: pointcount

    The total number of points to include in the group.

Attribute Seed:
    #id: percentattribute

    Point attribute to use as a seed for percent filtering.

=== Bounding ===

Enable:
    #id: enableboundingbox

    Enable filtering by a bounding box.

Mode:
    #id: boundingmode

    Whether to filter by a box or an object.

Name:
    #id: boundingname

    Name of the bounding geometry.


Size:
    #id: size

    Size of the bounding box.


Center:
    #id: center

    Center of the bounding box.

=== Level Set ===

Enable:
    #id: enablesdf

    Enable filtering by level set.

Name:
    #id: sdfname

    The name of the level set to filter by.


SDF Minimum:
    #id: sdfmin

    SDF Minimum value.

SDF Maximum:
    #id: sdfmax

    SDF Maximum value.

Invert:
    #id: sdfinvert

    Invert the sense of the SDF.

== Viewport ==

Specify a viewport group where only points in the viewport group are displayed in the viewport. This is useful to be able to create a group with just 1% of points for example, so to minimize the data transfer to the viewport without removing the data.

NOTE:
    Only one group can be tagged as a viewport group.

Enable:
    Enable the viewport group options.

Operation:
    Specify whether to add or remove the viewport group.

Name:
    Specify the name of the viewport group. Defaults to the name of the group in the first tab.
