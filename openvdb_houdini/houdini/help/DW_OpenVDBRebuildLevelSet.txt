= OpenVDB Rebuild Level Set =

"""Rebuild a level set VDB."""

The OpenVDB Rebuild Level Set SOP can adjust the isosurface value and/or the number of exterior and interior narrow-band voxels. This requires proper signed distance fields for the results to be meaningful.

NOTE:
    If you have significant departures from a proper signed distance field, you can rebuild it with the [OpenVDB From Polygons node|Node:sop/DW_OpenVDBFromPolygons].
    That node will implicitly convert an input SDF to polygons, then convert the polygons back to an SDF.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of the VDB volume primitives in the input to be normalized.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Isovalue:
	The isovalue that defines the implicit surface.

Use World Space Units:
	If enabled, specify the narrow-band region in world-space.

Exterior Band Voxels:
	Specify the width of the exterior (d >= 0) portion of the narrow band (3 voxel units is optimal for level set operations).

Interior Band Voxels:
	Specify the width of the interior (d < 0) portion of the narrow band (3 voxel units is optimal for level set operations).

Fill Interior:
	Extract signed distances for all interior voxels, this operation is going to densify the interior of the model. Requires a closed watertight model.
