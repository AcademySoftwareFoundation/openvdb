= OpenVDB Clip =

"""Clips VDB volume primitives using a bounding box or another VDB as a mask."""

This node removes (or deactivates) voxels from VDB volume primitives that are
outside the bounding box of the geometry given in the second input. A mask VDB may also be specified to perform an operation similar to an intersection.

@parameters

Source Group:
    Name(s) of the VDB primitives to clip. If empty, all VDBs are used.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Mask VDB:
    When enabled, it specifies the VDB primitives from the second input to be
    used as a clipping mask.

Keep Inside:
	When enabled, keep voxels that lie inside the clipping region, otherwise keep voxels that lie outside the clipping region.
