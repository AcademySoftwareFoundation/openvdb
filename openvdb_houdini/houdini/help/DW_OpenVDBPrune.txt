= OpenVDB Prune =

"""Prune tree branches from VDB grids."""

The OpenVDB Prune SOP can prune tree branches where values may all be the same to reduce the memory footprint of a VDB grid.

@parameters

Group:
    #id: group

    Which of the input VDBs to process.

Mode:
    Value:
        Collapse regions in which all voxels have the same
        value and active state into tiles with those values
        and active states.

    Inactive:
        Collapse regions in which all voxels are inactive
        into inactive background tiles.

    Level Set:
        Collapse regions in which all voxels are inactive
        into inactive tiles with either the inside or
        the outside background value, depending on
        the signs of the voxel values.

Tolerance:
    Voxel values are considered equal if they differ by less than the specified threshold.
