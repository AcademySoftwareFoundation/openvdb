"""Computes an analytic property of a VDB volumes, such as gradient or curvature."""

[Include:volume_types]

This node computes some property from the values of VDB volumes, and generates new VDB volumes where the voxel values are the computed results.
Using the __Output name__ parameter you can choose whether the results volumes replace the original volumes.

@parameters

Group:
    The name(s) of the VDB primitives to analyze.
    See [specifying volumes|/model/volumes#group].

Operator:
    What to compute. The labels on the items in the menu indicate what datatype the incoming VDB volume must be and the datatype of the output volume.

    Gradient (scalar -> vector):
        The gradient of a scalar field.

    Curvature (scalar -> scalar):
        Mean curvature of a scalar field.

    Laplacian (scalar -> scalar):
        The Laplacian of a scalar field.

    Closest Point (scalar -> vector):
        Generates voxels containing the location of the closest point on a surface defined by the incoming signed distance field.

        You can then use the resulting field with the [OpenVDB advect points node|Node:sop/DW_OpenVDBAdvectPoints] to stick points to the surface.

    Divergence (vector -> scalar):
        The divergence of a vector field.

    Curl (vector -> vector):
        The curl of a vector field.

    Magnitude (vector -> scalar):
        The length of the vectors in a vector field.

    Normalize (vector -> vector):
        Divides vector field's values by their lengths.

Mask VDB:
    VDB (from the second input) used to define the iteration space.

Output Name:
    How to name the generated VDB volumes. If you choose "Keep incoming names", the generated fields will replace the input fields.

Custom Name:
    If this is not blank, the output VDB will use this name.
