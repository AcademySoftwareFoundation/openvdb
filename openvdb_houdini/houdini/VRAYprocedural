//  VRAYprocedurals
//
//  This file contains the definitions for procedural objects loaded
//  into mantra.  The first column is the name of the procedure.  The
//  second column is the location of the dynamic object which handles
//  the procedure.  The dynamic object is loaded using path searching
//  on the HOUDINI_DSO_PATH variable (see hconfig for more
//  information)
//

//
// Since Windows dynamic objects have a different file extension than
// most unix platforms, we define a macro which makes the correct
// filename.  We also simplify the path construction a little.
