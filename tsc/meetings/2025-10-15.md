1) Confirm quorum

Quorum is present.

2) Secretary

Secretary is Andre Pradhana.

3) CI/Infrastructure Updates

Nick flagged issues on NanoVDB runners.
AX build: Now passing (Mac 13 to 14 transition fixed). Ken can merge
master into his branch to pick this up.
Houdini builds: Failures due to cache eviction during frequent
pipeline re‑runs. Proposal: add a "download Houdini if cache miss"
step (~3 minutes) to stabilize builds. Dan agrees.

4) Half‑Grid

PR 2106 (MVP): Introduces half‑grid type + serialization
(read/write).
Andre to add a unit test to create a half‑grid, write to disk, and
read it back. Dan prefers tests at the grid level (avoid leaf‑only
round‑trips), aligning with I/O rewrite goals.

PR 2101: Broader compute‑type application across tools.

Review feedback:
- Noted inconsistent rules and requested clarification on scope and
  defaults.
- Compute‑type should be opt‑in; not all arithmetic should silently
  upgrade precision. Greg proposed stencil/FD operators return float
  for half grids to avoid overflow/rounding churn. Nick emphasized
  maintaining ValueType semantics, and Ken noted that storage should
  remain an implementation detail to avoid API leakage.
- Suggested configurable return precision (default = ValueType) with
  the option for tools to opt into higher precision. Casting on access
  is acceptable, but expanding the grid API with templated getValue()
  is discouraged unless necessary.
- Agreed that for compute‑type, adopt tool‑by‑tool rollout with
  smaller, clearer MRs.
- Suggested order for broader tools: interpolation, morphology, key
  authoring tools, mesh/level‑set conversions.
- Proceed with MVP (PR 2106) first; unsupported tools reject half by
  default. Keep half-grid disabled in tools until individually vetted;
  remove static assert progressively.

5) I/O Rewrite Direction

Dan is removing legacy per‑node "micro‑stream" I/O; goal is
grid‑level serialization only, via staged deprecations. The aim is to
include deprecations in 13.x so removals can happen in VDB 14 next
year.

6) PRs Targeting VDB 13

2106 — Half‑grid MVP & serialization (Andre/Greg): Near‑ready; add
grid round‑trip test.
2101 — Compute‑type across tools (Greg): Scope to tool‑by‑tool; break
into smaller MRs.
2108 — NanoVDB changes (Ken): On list for 13.
2087 — Remove old I/O modes (Dan): Needs quick approval + changelist.
2102 — Target deprecations for 13.x to allow removals in 14.
2103 — Leaf buffer mask direct access (Dan): Add efficient access;
avoid ABI impact.
2105 — Use NumPy build. Pending Matthew's review.
2109 — PCA rasterized SDF work (Nick/Rich): Nice‑to‑have for 13;
otherwise later.

7) Additional topics (not yet PRs):

Delayed loading: Potential removal under discussion; requires
stakeholder input.

Internal node value mask mutability: Explore safer APIs for faster
initialization.

8) Next meeting

Cutoff: Assess readiness by next week; overall window through end of
month for 13.0 inclusion.

Next regular meeting scheduled for October 22nd, 2025.
