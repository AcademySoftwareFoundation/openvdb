------------

1) Confirm quorum

Quorum is present.

2) Secretary

Secretary is Jeff Lait.

3) Forum

OpenVDB added to Conda Forge.  Asked if we want to be involved as
maintainers.  We appreciate the work but do not want to maintain
things we are not directly involved with.

VDB View was reported not working on Windows.  This is likely not
surprising.  In the past this sort of error was from missing some
environment that could be solved with a .bat.  If we can reproduce we
can reply to that effect.  Finding TBB was the problem with vdb_tool.
CMake is trying to pick up GLU libraries.

4) Boost UUID

Are we able to merge this?  This has to look like a UUID as the old
code had to load it.  We reviewed this and approved during the
meeting.

5) Next meeting

Next meeting is on May 2nd, 2023. 2pm-3pm EDT.
