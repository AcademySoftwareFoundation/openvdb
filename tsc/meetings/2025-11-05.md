--------------------

1) Confirm quorum

Quorum is present.

2) Secretary

Secretary is Andre Pradhana.

3) Release Post-Mortem

- Upstream ecosystem churn
Recent changes to package managers (e.g., yum) and dependencies (NumPy,
TeXLive) impacted CI near the release window.
- Asserts coverage & build modes
Historically avoided asserts in Debug due to test time; now
OpenVDB_ENABLE_ASSERTS exists, enabling asserts without Debug build
overhead. Several issues slipped because release‑with‑asserts wasn't
running per‑commit.
- Floating‑point tolerance brittleness
Failures around overly tight tolerances (e.g., 1e-8), with Release vs.
Debug variances amplified by FMA/optimizer differences (especially in
Clang).
Quaternion/vector normalization checks were fragile; discussion favors
wider tolerances (e.g., 1e-6/1e-5), soft checks, or API preconditions
over hard asserts.
- Weekly/Nightly vs. Per‑Commit CI
Weekly CI accumulates failures; lacks visibility/accountability. Nightly
Debug runs existed but weren't well known and add cost.
Budget pressure: ASWF paid runners (esp. Windows) are costly; GitHub
hosted macOS used (slow but free for OSS).
- Intermittent Python segfaults
Sporadic crash‑on‑exit, more evident in Houdini builds; not fully
root‑caused.
- Sanitizers / ABI quirk
ASan unit test failure likely due to ABI difference in mapped file
class (atomic proxy vs. direct type) on Unix; patch incoming.

4) CI Strategy

CI Strategy — Proposals & Agreed Direction
Proposals:
- Run minimal subset of CI on PR updates; on Merge, run full weekly
pipeline and block merge if it fails.
- Explore GitHub support for merge‑time gates and (ideally) merge trains;
allow manual override for known infra breakages.
- Vet weekly CI: remove or migrate jobs to per‑commit where feasible;
move suitable jobs off ASWF runners to GitHub runners.
- Kill Nightly tier; use only Per‑Commit and Weekly.
- Add release‑mode with asserts to per‑commit CI.
- Set up build notifications (e.g., Tuesday digest before TSC) to surface
failing jobs and assign owners.
- For large PRs, require weekly CI to pass before merge.
- Triage: use first 5–10 min of TSC for CI triage only as needed;
  otherwise continue via email between meetings.

Consensus (current): proceed with asserts in per‑commit; remove
Nightly; notifications. Nick to investigates GitHub
merge‑gating/merge‑train capabilities and proposes a concrete plan.
Consolidate NanoVDB CI configs to avoid split logic.

5) Release Cadence

- Proposal: Move to timed releases (e.g., quarterly) to reduce pressure.
- Consensus: Try it this year; if a quarter is light, ship a small
point release that bundles vetted PRs.
- Marketing vs. notes: It's fine to highlight major features in the next
major even if they landed in an earlier point release—just don't
duplicate them in the bullet change notes.

6) Change Notes & Process Discipline

Gap observed: NanoVDB work landed in a patch without appearing in
change notes.

Remedies discussed:
- Use a bot/check to nudge for missing/invalid change notes (not
  necessarily hard-blocking, but visible).
- Reviewers explicitly verify change notes during TSC review.

7) ABI Namespace Versioning

Discussion: Whether to remove minor version in namespace for 13.x.

Outcome: Keep minor-versioned namespaces (status quo). Consumers like
Houdini can pin/patch as needed.

8) Documentation Improvements

- Proposal (Nick): Adopt Doxygen Awesome CSS for better UX (dark mode,
improved search, sidebar TOC, permalinks, copy-code).
- AX snippets can be extracted and executed via CLI in CI; fail if
broken.
- Idea from Jeff: the inverse—generate docs snippets from real test
harnesses so examples always compile.
- Jonathan: fVDB runs doc examples in CI (inspired by Weta); similar
pattern encouraged for OpenVDB.

9) Next meeting

Next meeting is in two weeks, Nov 19th, 2025. 1pm-2pm PST.
