------------

1) Confirm quorum

Quorum is present.

2) Secretary

Secretary is Andre Pradhana.

3) Half support
Andre and Greg will meet to discuss what needs to be implemented for Autodesk
purposes. As for the implementation, we may need to promote the Half type to a
float type when doing arithmetic.

4) Post mortem VDB 11 release
We ended up meeting the VFX reference platform deadline. Ken sent out an
announcement on the email list that 11.0.0 is out there. We still need to fix
weekly builds on the CI.

5) Dilation at leaf level for NanoVDB
Cuda’s points-to-voxel grid can copy 26 points. It will be nice to have a
dedicated tool to dilate at the leaf level. Andre will touch base with Alexandre
to follow up on this effort.

6) PR-1678
This is no longer needed as the CMake module is no longer there.

7) Update documentation
We need to update the installation which is currently openexr 2.x to OpenEXR 3.x.

8) CMake config file
It will be good to have a nice OpenVDB CMake config file.

9) Using VDB SOPs inside of DOPs
It’s supposed to work with zero-copy.

10) Annual update on TAC
There is an annual project update for the TSC on November 29, 2023, which may
require some material.

11) Next meeting
Next meeting is November 14, 2023.
