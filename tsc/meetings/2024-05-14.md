------------

1) Confirm quorum

Quorum is present.

2) Secretary

Secretary is Greg Hurst.

3) continued fVDB discussion

fVDB will be configured to use the main-line NanoVDB and will stay that way and not diverge

PR is 1808

Move github actions to main CI

Do we need to wait for a GPU to run CI for fVDB? Currently for Nano we build it but don't run tests. We could do the same for fVDB for the time being.

NVIDIA internal repo could run tests for now

Would this benefit from gitlfs? -- large-ish data in unit tests
10's of MB
Perhaps have separate "fVDB data" repo for testing

fVDB is first subpackage that will distribute prebuilt binaries
opt-in to the CI to build and upload to pypy

4) NanoVDB namespaces

PR 1807 -- new namespaces and modifies tons of files

It will need client code to update, but shouldn't be to cumbersome to update code.

Stuck because the CI is failing.

fVDB is branched off this branch

Seems in this branch you need CUDA 12.x, which seems fishy

5) CI issues

NanoVDB Mac & Windows failing. We should wait to merge PRs until this is fixed.
