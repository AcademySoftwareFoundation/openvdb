Jonathan has worked on taking out `openvdb_maya` to the OpenVDB Org. The intent
is to archive it, signaling it as unsupported. Archiving the repository
(GitHub “read-only” status) will serve as a clear indicator of its deprecated
status.

CLA (Contributor License Agreement) Issues: Andre volunteered to contact DreamWorks
to verify CLA coverage for openvdb-dev team account managed by DWA.

Jonathan will add everyone in the TSC to the OpenVDB Org as admin.

Suggestion on creating a Google Doc to outline which repos should be created. The
OpenVDB website and Dan's SIGGRAPH 2021 example codes were suggested
(https://github.com/danrbailey/siggraph2021_openvdb).
