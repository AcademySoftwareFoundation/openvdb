------------


1) Confirm quorum

Quorum is present.


2) Secretary

Secretary is Greg Hurst.


3) PRs

1687 need another approval and CLI
1685 abstraction layer. 
  122 files changed
  wrapper around TBB
  higher level wrappers in nano:
    for_each, reduce, ...
    define a functor that you do parallel_reduce over
    std::thread implementation & serial fallback functionality
  similar TBB mechanisms we use in the codebase, we should consolidate this at first
  use case here is if you have your own thread pool
  another is to be able to build OpenVDB without TBB
  
  OpenVDB needs to have it's own highlevel parallel functionality that just uses TBB under the hood
  grainsize is important keep exposed
1679
  checking for the grid but dereferencing the iterator
  looks good to go
  
4) Root Node TBB concurrent hash node
  violates ABI?
  we should get rid of this

5) ABI changes in NanoVDB
  Nano has its own versioning system
  Do we adopt same ABI change policies for nano used in OpenVDB
  So now is the time to change the ABI

6) VDB 11
  Need people to look at infrastructure changes
  Removes support for ilmBase
  Does this build with Houdini 20?
    10.1 works just fine
  Closer to removing Boost dependencies (still optional for delayed loading)
