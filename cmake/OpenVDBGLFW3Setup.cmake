OpenVDBGLFW3Setup
-----------------

Wraps the call the FindPackage ( glfw3 ) for OpenVDB builds. Provides
some extra options for finding the glfw3 installation without polluting
the OpenVDB Binaries cmake.

Use this module by invoking include with the form::

  include ( OpenVDBGLFW3Setup )

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``glfw``
  The glfw3 library target.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This will define the following variables:

``glfw3_FOUND``
  True if the system has glfw3 installed.
``glfw3_VERSION``
  The version of the glfw3 library which was found.

Hints
^^^^^

The following variables may be provided to tell this module where to look.

``GLFW3_ROOT``
  Preferred installation prefix.

#]=======================================================================]

# Find the glfw3 installation and use glfw's CMake to initialize
# the glfw lib

SET ( _GLFW3_ROOT_SEARCH_DIR "" )

IF ( GLFW3_ROOT )
  LIST ( APPEND _GLFW3_ROOT_SEARCH_DIR ${GLFW3_ROOT} )
ELSE ()
  SET ( _ENV_GLFW_ROOT $ENV{GLFW3_ROOT} )
  IF ( _ENV_GLFW_ROOT )
    LIST ( APPEND _GLFW3_ROOT_SEARCH_DIR ${_ENV_GLFW_ROOT} )
  ENDIF ()
ENDIF ()

# Additionally try and use pkconfig to find glfw, though we only use
# pkg-config to re-direct to the cmake. In other words, glfw's cmake is
# expected to be installed
FIND_PACKAGE ( PkgConfig )
PKG_CHECK_MODULES ( PC_glfw3 QUIET glfw3 )

IF ( PC_glfw3_FOUND )
  FOREACH ( DIR ${PC_glfw3_LIBRARY_DIRS} )
    LIST ( APPEND _GLFW3_ROOT_SEARCH_DIR ${DIR} )
  ENDFOREACH ()
ENDIF ()

IF ( GLFW3_CMAKE_LOCATION )
